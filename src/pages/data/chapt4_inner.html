        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>It was after four in the afternoon when my father suddenly appeared at my second daughter Kinue's house.</p>
            <p>"What's the matter, dad?" she said.</p>
            <p>He replied, "Yes, I have something I want to talk to Yutaka about."</p>
            <p>It was the same as before. Whenever there were important matters, my father relied on his son-in-law, Yutaka Kubo. However, today was different.</p>
            <p>"What time is he coming home?" my father asked.</p>
            <p>"I haven't heard anything about his plans for this evening, but I might give him a call," she said.</p>
            <p>Kinue, my older sister, had been instructed by her husband to avoid calling his office during work hours as much as possible. However, she had no choice but to break this rule when she saw the expression on our father's face, as if he was deep in thought.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Kubo, you have a phone call. I'll transfer it to you," Kinue said.</p>
            <p>Kubo picked up the receiver, prompted by Toyama, the clerk’s high-pitched voice.</p>
            <p>"Your father-in-law is here. Please finish your plans for the evening as soon as possible and come home," Kinue said.</p>
            <p>"I'll try to leave as soon as possible," he told her.</p>
            <p>What's wrong? Kubo was surprised to see his father-in-law, who usually contacted him in advance to ensure he was available. He felt uneasy.</p>
            <p>Looking at his schedule, he saw that he had one meeting that was not so urgent. He instructed his subordinate to reschedule it and hurried home.</p>
            <p>His father-in-law had hardly touched the dinner in front of him.</p>
            <p>"Please have some awamori (Okinawa liquor)," Yutaka said.</p>
            <p>He usually only sipped a modest cup of awamori, no matter how much they encouraged him to drink. However, he was already on his third glass.</p>
            <p>Yutaka sensed that something was amiss.</p>
            <p>"Please stay the night," he said.</p>
            <p>"No, I'm leaving..." his father-in-law said.</p>
            <p>For a while, his father-in-law engaged in idle chit-chat and answered half-heartedly.</p>
            <p>"What's wrong?" Yutaka asked.</p>
            <p>"Um..."</p>
            <p>"What's wrong?" Yutaka asked again.</p>
            <p>"Yutaka... Toshio, it's about Toshio..."</p>
            <p>His father-in-law stopped talking again.</p>
            <p>"What's wrong with Toshio?"</p>
            <p>"I want to get him out of Yagaji."</p>
            <p>"Is he cured?"</p>
            <p>"No, I'm going to help him escape. I want to send him to Yamato."</p>
            <p>After saying this, he downed his fourth cup.</p>
            <p>"When?"</p>
            <p>"In March. As soon as possible."</p>
            <p>My father explained to my brother-in-law, Yutaka, what I had told him.</p>
            <p>"I see. I was concerned about him. Did he say he wanted to study? That's good... If he wants to go to Yamato, he'll need a passport. In March? We should hurry."</p>
            <p>"Yutaka, do you have any contacts?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, I do. Just in time, my childhood friend Okubo is working in passport services, so I'll ask him about the passport. Where are you planning to take Toshio?"</p>
            <p>"Kagoshima." </p>
            <p>"I see. Kagoshima... Do you remember K? He stayed with me at Mr. Matsuzaki's place. He is now a section chief at Ryukyu Shipping, so I will ask him for a boarding ticket." </p>
            <p>"Yutaka, will you ask him?" </p>
            <p>"Sure." </p>
            <p>"Thank you. Thank you very much, Yutaka." My father finally seemed relieved. He refused the offer of a ride home the next morning and boarded the last bus to Ishikawa.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>Soon, Yutaka called Okubo and K the next day. The passport issue was going to be relatively easy to resolve. </p>
            <p>"Mr. Kubo, please prepare three photos of my brother-in-law's upper body. I'll use them for private business purposes, as he is studying abroad. With his father as his guardian, let's apply for his passport. I will prepare the necessary documents for them later." </p>
            <p>Arranging for the embarkation was tricky. </p>
            <p>"Yutaka, is there anything wrong with his arms and legs?" </p>
            <p>"Yes, there is. The fingers of both hands are crooked." </p>
            <p>"I see. ...hands, you know. If it is alright, it is not so difficult to make him blend in with ordinary passengers.... Both at Tomari Port before boarding and in Kagoshima Bay before disembarking, strict checks are conducted according to the Immigration Control Order and the Quarantine Law. Among infectious diseases, leprosy is especially strictly regulated." </p>
            <p>"If that happens, we'll deal with it then. I want to make my brother-in-law's dream come true. Please do something." </p>
            <p>"If they find out, he and his father will be denied boarding or deported..." My brother-in-law's enthusiasm finally moved K.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>There is a later story about my involvement with Mr. K. </p>
            <p>"Yutaka, isn't Toshio Iha, who was just on the Ryukyu Broadcasting System, your brother-in-law at that time? Is he the boy we let escape to Kagoshima?" </p>
            <p>"Yes, that's right. He is my brother-in-law, the one you saved at that time." </p>
            <p>"I see..." </p>
            <p>The voice of K on the phone paused for a moment. </p>
            <p>"I was prepared to be fired for helping him back then. But he had turned out to be such a good worker. I'm glad I did something useful for him." Mr. K was in a key position as a director of Ryukyu Marine Transport at that time. </p>
            <p>On December 9, 1987, when I was the chairperson of the organizing committee for the "Zenkoro United Nations - Decade of Disabled Persons Mid-Year Event," TBS aired this commemorative event on its "Prime Time" program. It was during this program that he saw me.</p>
            <p>On December 9, 1975, the 30th United Nations General Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In connection with the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the year 1981 was designated as the International Year of Persons with Disabilities. It was resolved that the decade 1983-1992 be designated as the UN Decade of Disabled Persons, with member countries promoting normalization measures for persons with disabilities under the goal theme of "full participation and equality." In Japan, social awareness-raising events were held by the public and private sectors during the International Year of Persons with Disabilities. However, after that, the issue of social independence for the disabled became a somewhat fading social concern. The National Association Zenkoro (formerly the National Association of Colonies with 3000 members), an incorporated association that promotes the social independence of persons with disabilities through occupational activities, held its own nationwide event during the middle year of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons with the intention of raising social awareness of disability issues once again.</p>

        <h2 id="flashing">Flashing</h2>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>On March 3, 1960, I received a letter from my father. </p>
            <p>It said, ‘On March 6’, I will take you out of Airakuen. At 7:30 p.m., a small boat will be anchored at Untenbaru. The signal will be three flashes of a flashlight and no personal belongings of any kind are allowed. March 7, depart Tomari Port on the Naha Maru. </p>
            <p>The message was simple and clear. </p>
            <p>I made sure no one was around me and I told my dormitory father. </p>
            <p>“I got a letter from my father. It's March 6.” </p>
            <p>“Oh, so the time has come. It's finally here.” </p>
            <p>Mr. Kishimoto hugged me and took out three envelopes from the back of a drawer. From one of the kraft envelopes, he pulled out a folded piece of paper and unfolded it in front of me. </p>
            <p>“When you have decided on the ship you will be on, send a telegram here. The contact will be made. You will surely be picked up at Kagoshima Port. I have already sent him a picture of you, Susumu.” The paper contained contact information. </p>
            <p></p>
            <pre><i>
    Hoshizuka Keiaien 
    4204 Hoshizuka-cho, Kanoya City, Kagoshima Prefecture
    Yaeo Ishigaki 
            </i></pre>
            <p></p>
            <p>“The envelope contains a certificate of graduation. Give it to Mr. Ishigaki when you arrive at Keiaien. This is a furlough permission form that I prepared just in case. I had asked Mr. K to write it for you before he retired,” </p>
            <p>Mr. Kishimoto said, ‘The escape plan’ was kept secret from everyone except the dorm parents. </p>
            <p>I began to sort through my belongings, as if nothing had happened. </p>
            <p>I had already given the dorm father a list of where to distribute my main possessions. </p>
            <p>Did Masakazu sense something? He, who was now in the fourth grade, asked anxiously. </p>
            <p>“Big brother, are you going somewhere?”, he asked. </p>
            <p>“Uh-uh, I'm not going anywhere.”, I said. </p>
            <p>He heard the same question again that night from his bed. </p>
            <p>“Big brother, where are you going?” </p>
            <p>“I'm not going anywhere. I always stay with you.” </p>
            <p>“Really?” </p>
            <p>However, for the next three nights until our last night in Airakuen, He fell asleep with his hands clutching the cuffs of my sleeves. During the day, he would run home from school and even follow me to the bathroom.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>March 6, 1960. Untenbaru is located on the west side of Yagaji Island, within arm's reach of Unten Harbor across the sea. </p>
            <p>Masakazu was taken to the TV room, the only one in the sanatorium. </p>
            <p>It was now 6:45 PM.</p>
            <p>"It's about time to go," </p>
            <p>The dorm father's voice urged me to leave the boys' and girls' dormitories.</p>
            <p>"Susumu, where are you going?" </p>
            <p>I had no choice but to ignore the call from upstairs, my best friend, Ryuji.</p>
            <p>The dorm father Kishimoto, dorm mother Minami, and I hurried through the west section of the sanatorium and along a path in the pine forest. </p>
            <p>The boundary between the sanatorium and the outside world was separated by a pathway that was regularly patrolled. After crossing this path, we continued our slow descent to Untenbaru.</p>
            <p>It was already dark, and the waves stirred by the monsoon of the second month of the lunar calendar were lapping against the wooden landing platform, which had been joined together with a wooden plank. The three of us sat down in the pandanus fruit forest near the landing and waited.</p>
            <p>The wind blew the leaves. Around the port of Unten on the other side of the river, a few lights could be seen.</p>
            <p>"It will soon be 7:30," Father Kishimoto's mumbled voice reached my ears.</p>
            <p>The light flashed three times in the darkness. </p>
            <p>"Here they come! Susumu, go. I'll make sure everyone else follows," Mr. Kishimoto said.</p>
            <p>"Take care, Susumu!" </p>
            <p>As I ran away, I heard the small voice of dorm mother Minami behind me.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>“...Toshio, sorry for making you wait. Watch your step,” my father said. </p>
            <p>The light from the flashlight illuminated the small boat beneath my feet. After making sure I got on board, my father bowed deeply into the darkness. </p>
            <p>From time to time, the oar tapped against the side of the boat. The port of Unten is right in front of us. My father called out to the boatman. </p>
            <p>“Brother, could you take us to the pine tree on the left instead of the pier?” </p>
            <p>“There are so many pebbles there, you will get your feet wet,” the boatman said. </p>
            <p>“That's fine.” </p>
            <p>The bow of the small boat scraped the bottom as it rose up. My body was on fire from the strain, and the knee-deep wet winter sea felt good to me. </p>
            <p>After passing through Unten village, we walked along the mountain path for nearly 30 minutes, but my father's flashlight was never turned on. Even so, when I strained my eyes in the starlight, I could make out the path, which was clearly different in whiteness from the surroundings. We tiptoed down the hill and found a taxi waiting for us at the edge of the road on the outskirts of the village. </p>
            <p>We got in, and the driver silently started the car. As the taxi departed, my father looked outside and took a deep breath. </p>
            <p>The taxi passed through Nago and continued driving on the west line without turning left at Kyoda. The taxi passed Maekaneku. </p>
            <p>“Huh?” </p>
            <p>To get to my house from Nakadomari, the car should have turned left, but it kept going straight. The car drove until it was near Mt. Takou and finally stopped. </p>
            <p>“As we reached Kadena, there were American soldiers in town and it was noisy, so let's go back from here and go through to Ginoza,” the driver said. </p>
            <p>The strange way this taxi was driving had already been discussed between my father and the driver. ...I understood immediately. My father was trying to escape from the fact that my escape from Airakuen had been exposed and I was being brought back. </p>
            <p>The car turned back the way it just came and turned right from Onna. </p>
            <p>This road runs on the back side of Mt. Ishikawa. My house is on the other side of this mountain... </p>
            <p>I thought to myself as I listened to the occasional sound of twigs hitting the car. </p>
            <p>The car stopped at the edge of the village of Ginoza. My father called out to me for the first time. </p>
            <p>“Toshio, do you want to see all your family members?” </p>
            <p>“...No, thanks.” </p>
            <p>I gave a mindless answer. Again, my father asked. </p>
            <p>“Toshio, shall we go home?” </p>
            <p>Then, for a while, the conversation in the car was cut short. </p>
            <p>“Toshimasa, can you head home?” my father said. </p>
            <p>“Yes, that would be good. I feel sorry for the child...” the driver said. </p>
            <p>The driver cried while driving. He, whom my late father had called "Toshimasa," I have never been able to find. </p>
            <p>“Toshio, you must be hungry. I forgot all about it.” </p>
            <p>My father unfolded a rice ball wrapped in a banana leaf. As I chewed on the rice ball, the sweet taste of the oiled miso spread in my mouth. </p>
            <p>We climbed through the back window to enter our home. It was my home for the first time in three years. </p>
            <p>The eyes of my family, lined up around my grandmother, stared at me. </p>
            <p>I silently bowed my head. </p>
            <p>It was 10:30 in the evening. </p>
            <p>I only had a few more hours left to be with my family.</p>
            <p>　</p>

        <h2 id="oneway-passport">Oneway Passport</h2>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>My grandmother has been rubbing my hands since I woke up in the morning. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, you have to cover your hands," repeated Sister Atsuko over and over again. In addition, she taught me how to hold the overcoat with both hands and even made me rehearse it. </p>
            <p>My grandmother sat me down in front of the altar. Behind her, who was holding incense sticks and joining her hands together, I also joined my hands together. I could hear my mother crying behind my back. </p>
            <p>I had made up my mind not to cry this time when I left Airakuen, so strangely enough, I was able to face my mother's crying calmly. </p>
            <p>But the stifled cries of her mother were about to break a certain tension that had been building up in the house. Sister Fumiko, always the calm one, stood up. </p>
            <p>"I'm going to leave first with Toshio. I'm going to drop by Mr. Matsuzaki's house in Naha," she said. </p>
            <p>Once again, my father's cautiousness was well prepared. We were divided into two groups: my sister Fumiko and I, and my father and the family members who were seeing me off. </p>
            <p>"Okay, Fumiko. I'll see you in the waiting room at Tomari Port at seven o'clock," my brother Yoshiyasu said. </p>
            <p>As I was putting on my shoes, he called out to me. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, I'll give you this...take it with you." </p>
            <p>It was an English-Japanese dictionary from Sanseido, with writing on every page. </p>
            <p>Atsuko called out to me again. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, keep your hands covered." </p>
            <p>The Naha Maru bound for Kagoshima was scheduled to depart at 8:00 am. A rope was stretched to the embarkation gate, and the people who were to see off passengers lined up on the outside of the rope. The nervous faces of my family members, with the exception of my grandmother, were also lined up. One by one, the passengers were ushered through the interior. I followed my father, my hands covered, holding an overcoat, which is never worn in Okinawa. Looking around, I saw that not a single person had an overcoat on his or her person. We thought we were being cautious and prepared, but instead we stood out. </p>
            <p>Three desks were lined up in three locations leading up to the boarding gate, and at the desk by the entrance, a Ryukyu Marine Transport employee was checking tickets. </p>
            <p>"Third class, two. Yes, thank you." </p>
            <p>Atsuko was moving along the outside of the rope as we were moving forward. </p>
            <p>At the next desk sat two uniformed officers. Arms folded, they simply watched the passengers as they passed. We passed through that desk without incident as well. </p>
            <p>At the last desk, a U.S. military officer was taking passports from each passenger and inspecting them. </p>
            <p>My father got an ‘OK.’ </p>
            <p>It was my turn next. He flipped through the passport with a flip-flop. </p>
            <p>"Stop!" </p>
            <p>An American soldier shouted. </p>
            <p>Oh, no! I've been found out! </p>
            <p>I felt sweat running down my armpits. My father turned back to me, his face a deep blue. </p>
            <p>"Your sign, please," the American soldier said. </p>
            <p>He pulled a fountain pen from his breast pocket, handed it to me, and pointed to a blank page in my passport. </p>
            <p>At the top of the page was written "Self-written signature," and my passport was left unsigned. </p>
            <p>I wrote "Toshio Iha" on the blank page. He winked back as he took the fountain pen from me. </p>
            <p>"OK-Good luck," he said. </p>
            <p>My passport, signed ‘Ryukyu Resident Toshio Iha,’ was used only one way, as Okinawa Prefecture was returned to Japan in 1972. </p>
            <p>Gongs were sounded, and "Firefly Light" (a farewell song) played over the speakers. Colorful tapes fluttered the wind between passengers and those who saw them off. The Naha Maru quietly left the wharf with a number of whirlpools in its wake. My father and I stood side by side, staring at the crowd bidding us farewell. The eyes of the family as one lump were fixed on my father and me. Sister Atsuko nodded and gestured for me to cover my hands with the overcoat. The overcoat was held firmly to my chest, and my hands were in it. </p>
            <p>Once on board, my father behaved in two inexplicable ways. He firmly grasped my right arm and didn’t release his grip. </p>
            <p>The first time was until we could no longer see the shadow of the main island of Okinawa, and the second time was after the Naha Maru entered Kinko Bay, and the ship announced that quarantine would soon begin.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>What was the reason for this strange behavior of my father? </p>
            <p>I told my family about it more than ten years later. </p>
            <p>Yoshiyasu asked me, "I remember there is a photo in the album of our father and Toshio standing side by side on the deck, staring out to sea. Is this the picture then?" he said. </p>
            <p>"The picture was not taken on board the Naha Maru, but on the deck of the Nankai Yusen in Kagoshima Bay. It was taken by Mr. Yamada, who came to pick us up," I said. </p>
            <p>My mother, who had been silently listening to our conversation, spoke up, "The night before we were to take Toshio to Kagoshima, your father told me, 'If Toshio's illness is revealed, we may not be able to make it to Kagoshima. Then we'll both jump into the ocean together. Even if we could land in Kagoshima, the hospital in Kagoshima might not accept Toshio. If you don't hear from me, give up waiting for us...' He left me with detailed instructions on how to dispose of his property and told me to take care of the children.Two days before your departure, we went to a photo studio to take our last picture together. Wait a minute, there should be a picture of that time," she said. </p>
            <p>My mother put a picture wrapped in Japanese paper in front of everyone. The picture showed my father and mother side by side, dressed in formal attire. </p>
            <p>I said, "Oh, you have a picture like this? Did you know about this, sister Yoneko?" </p>
            <p>"No, this is the first I've heard of it. Why didn't you tell us before? That's so him. He was so prepared and never complained," she said. </p>
            <p>"No, your father has mentioned dying twice," my mother said. </p>
            <p>The children surrounding my mother shouted in surprise. </p>
            <p>"Once, maybe a month after Toshio went to the sanatorium in Yagaji, we were on our way back from being invited to Mr. Hamasaki's housewarming party in Higashiyama when your father started to say something strange. He said, 'Let's stop for a walk.' I thought that was an unusual thing to say. He had never invited anyone for a walk before. He had a few drinks, so I thought he must be drunk and followed him. He told me to go down to the beach on the way to Kombu. He told me to sit here, and I sat there for a while. Suddenly, he asked me to die with him. I asked him why he suddenly said such a foolish thing. Then he said, 'Four years ago, I finally got over Okinori's suicide, and now Toshio's illness. I've lost the will to live with all the noise and laughter of the celebrations.'" </p>
            <p>Neither the older sister nor the older brother could speak. </p>
            <p>"I had said, 'Oh, you've lost your mind. No, I can't do that. If you want to die, you must die alone. There are still many other children left. I don't know who among them will succeed. I will look forward to this, and I will raise my children,'" she also said. </p>
            <p>"I was pathetic because that father said such a thing. I left him alone and came home as soon as I could." </p>
            <p>For us children, this was the first time we had ever heard of our father. </p>
            <p>"Unlike me, he was too serious and died early. I was a simple woman, so I was able to live a long life, see unusual things, and eat delicious food. If only he had lived longer," she said. </p>
            <p>My father died on February 20, 1979. He had a cerebral hemorrhage and never regained consciousness. Six months later, at the age of 82, he died. It was a very quiet death, as if he was fading away.</p>
