        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>My brother Yoshiyasu, who is two years older than I am, and I were on our way home from visiting a grave. Okinawan folk songs were playing in the car.</p>
            <p>In late April 1996, the mountains were vibrant, bathed in sunlight.</p>
            <p>"It's this wind that brings out the moisture of nature, isn't it? Urizun (the second and third months of the lunar calendar) is the best time of the year."</p>
            <p>"I agree. Toshio, do you remember this place? We used to go to our aunt's house in Izumi, and we used to walk along this road together. I remember we used to get scared on the way there and run, tightly holding each other's hands. The amount of water in the Oi River has decreased considerably. By the way, have you ever climbed Oppadake?"</p>
            <p>"I think I was in the first grade of elementary school when I followed my older brothers up there to pick Rubus sieboldii Blume... I was told to throw a stone into the bushes before entering because there were hubs (Okinawa poison snakes) under the branches of the Rubus sieboldii Blume that went after small birds. So, I entered with trepidation... It has been more than 40 years since then."</p>
            <p>"Right... it's still early, so let's make a side trip."</p>
            <p>From the middle of the Tamashiro and Gogayama villages, the car headed west with the engine revving at high speed. The road was only wide enough for a few cars to pass each other, but the paved road extended into the mountains.</p>
            <p>"Is this road used for everyday life?"</p>
            <p>"No, I don't think more than a dozen cars pass this road in a day. Nowadays, roads are being built everywhere with the Act on Special Measures for the Promotion and Development of Okinawa signboards. They are destroying nature by continuously cutting down mountains and pouring concrete just to let cars drive on them... They burned down the mountains during the war, and now they are pouring state money into the mountains and cutting down trees... Just when the mountains are finally recovering, man's violence in destroying them one after another is completely irredeemable..." said my brother, a teacher and nature conservation activist. His voice was tinged with anger.</p>
            <p>"What is that light yellow-green, hairy tree in the middle of the mountain?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, that's a Japanese chinquapin," he said.</p>
            <p>"I have been smelling a nice, sweet scent for a little while now."</p>
            <p>"It's the scent of Japanese chinquapin and Rhaphiolepis indica Lindl. It is the time of year when the fragrance of flowers competes with the fresh greenery. The flora here is at most 50 years old, but the area is a mixture of subtropical and temperate zones. In the past, this area was covered with dense camphor forests, but most of the original landscape has been lost as the Japanese Army cut down the trees for military purposes, and the area was burned down by US naval gunfire."</p>
            <p>After climbing for about 20 minutes, we stopped the car. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, this is the area known as Kusunokiyama. During the war, my family fled to this mountain. Let's get out of the car and take a short walk."</p>
            <p>When we stepped out of the car, the forest with shiny leaves spread out before us, catching the sun. The gentle breeze that rustles the leaves is warm, while the mountain wind is cool, creating a complex airflow through my body.</p>
            <p>"If you continue up this road, you will reach the summit of Oppadake. I believe the peak is about 270 meters high. The surrounding area has now been developed as a lookout point, with a TV station at its center."</p>
            <p>My brother entered a grove of trees and descended the gentle slope as if he were accustomed to it. My footing was uncertain due to leaf litter. After a while, he stopped under a camphor tree the size of his girth and stroked its trunk. </p>
            <p>"It is over 80 years old when it is this thick. How did it survive?" "Do you have any memories of the war, brother?" </p>
            <p>"I was only three years old then... Well, so I only have faint memories of being carried on my grandmother's back in the rain." </p>
            <p>Or perhaps this camphor tree was watching us as we fled in the midst of the war. </p>
            <p>We headed for the summit of Oppadake again. We parked the car, and when we reached the gently sloping summit, we both held our breath. </p>
            <p>It was as if a wisp of cloud had been left behind, with white clover covering the hill, its petals dancing in the wind. </p>
            <p>"It's magnificent, isn't it? I have never seen such a dense cluster." </p>
            <p>The observatory was deserted, with only a young couple huddled together. "This time of year, the yellow sand creates a blue haze. The village stretching out directly in front of us below is Nakasone. It is the village where my family lived for about 10 years after we were repatriated from Minamidaito Island. That chimney over there is the sugar factory, so the forest a little to the left is where our house used to be," my brother said.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The village that he pointed out stretched out in front of the foothills. </p>
            <p>"That sea is the East China Sea, and the gentle island in front is Kouri Island. That island, too, will soon have a bridge built over it. On the right is the Hanechi Inland Sea. In front of it, looking like a continuation of the land, is Yagaji Island, Yagaji..." </p>
            <p>My brother repeated the name Yagaji Island twice. </p>
            <p>"Yagaji, I was on that island for three years. It has been thirty-six years since I fled from Yagaji Island..." </p>
            <p>When my brother led me back from Yamahara (a generic name for the northern part of Okinawa Island), my mother, sisters Yoneko and Atsuko were anxiously waiting for us to return home, which was later than planned.</p>
            <p>"Oh, you came back late. I heard you climbed Oppadake, how was it? Kusunokiyama is no longer the same as it was back then... That mountain left me with nothing but fear when I was a little girl, but it's strange. It's a mountain I want to go to when something goes wrong," </p>
            <p>Atsuko said, pouring herself a cup of tea, saying she has been there many times. </p>
            <p>She said, "We don't get together to talk about the age of war unless it's an opportunity like this. Mom is the star of the show today, so you have to answer Toshio's interview questions." </p>
            <p>"I'm not sure an old woman like me could remember everything." </p>
            <p>The tape recorder was switched on.</p>
            <p></p>

        <h2 id="minamidaito-island">Minamidaito Island</h2>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>I, Toshio Iha, was born on March 14, 1943, on Minamidaito Island, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. I am the fourth son among four boys and six girls, including two half-siblings. My father was 46 years old, and my mother was 39 at the time of my birth.</p>
            <p>Minamidaito Island is located 350 km east of the main island of Okinawa and covers an area of 26 square kilometers. It is a flat plateau surrounded by precipitous cliffs and is a small island whose main product has been brown sugar since that time. </p>
            <p>My family was relatively wealthy, being farmers with 13tyoubu (1tyoubu=9,900square meters) of cultivated land and five servants. </p>
            <p>My late father used to describe the size of the family's farmland as "a narrow-gauge railroad" running through the family's fields, so it is understandable that the family occupied such a large land.</p>
            <p>My ninety-two-year-old mother frowns and tugs at her memories of that time. </p>
            <p>"As soon as he finished his farm work, he would change into a white suit and a Panama hat and go out, but when the army arrived, his clothes were quickly put away in a closet." </p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>"In 1944, right after Toshio's birthday, a large contingent of guards came to the house, maybe 350 of them, and soon after that day, the generals and civilian dignitaries came to the house with them. The only written order we received was a flimsy one: Tomorrow, at 12:00 p.m., this house will be confiscated as the regiment's headquarters."</p>
            <p>"We couldn't disagree with them. It was the biggest house on the island. ...Then they evicted the others, and the soldiers moved into their houses. And the islanders? They had no choice but to live in workshops and barns. The soldiers were skilled in everything..." </p>
            <p>On February 17, 1944, the Truk Islands, the central base of the Allied Fleet in the Pacific, were defeated by the US 58th Task Force, and in July, Saipan Island was also defeated. As a result, Daito Island became an increasingly crucial part of the defense line. </p>
            <p>Under the policy of "defending Daito Island, the eastern mainland defense line," the Japanese Army decided to incorporate the 85th Logistics Garrison stationed at Daito Island into the 32nd Army to strengthen the defense of Daito Island. </p>
            <p>The cargo ship Minami Maru had already been torpedoed and sunk in the waters surrounding Daito Island, and Oki Daito Island was also under submarine attack. The supply force dispatched to reinforce the defense of Daito Island was also in a tense situation, where Captain Yokota and 19 others were killed in action just before landing. </p>
            <p>Shortly thereafter, a military order was issued to the residents of Daito Island: "All civilians must evacuate to Miyazaki Prefecture." </p>
            <p>"My husband negotiated many times with the command headquarters because he could not leave his mother on the main island of Okinawa and evacuate to faraway Miyazaki..." </p>
            <p>"Is it about his ex-wife's mother? His ex-wife's mother and Yoshiko remained alone in Nakijin village because Yoshiko, thier child with his ex-wife, was suffering from tuberculosis." </p>
            <p>After repeated negotiations, our family was finally allowed to return home on a special military ship. </p>
            <p>"Since there was no port on Minamidaito Island, we were first dropped off at a barge by a mokko (an implement for carrying heavy loads, generally made of bamboo and woven grass or rope) suspended from a crane and then transferred to a ship offshore. After that came the hard part. What would normally have taken us less than a day to reach Okinawa took three days due to trying to evade an American submarine. We went back and forth over the ocean. We couldn't turn on the lights or speak because it would give away our position. Toshio had just turned one year old, and it was difficult to get him to stop crying. The ship constantly rocked with torpedoes being fired at us..." </p>
            <p>"It's a pathetic situation, the war."</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>On October 10, 1944, it was a dazzlingly clear morning on the island of Okinawa. </p>
            <p>The U.S. 38th Task Force first launched about 130 fighter planes and quickly seized control of the airspace. More than 1,000 bombers and torpedoes then bombed military installations, major cities, and villages one after another. The first wave occurred from 7:00 to 8:20 a.m., the second from 9:20 a.m. for about an hour, the third from 11:45 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and the fourth from 12:40 to 1:40 p.m. The fifth wave lasted from 2:45 p.m. to 3:45 p.m., during which 500 tons of bombs and incendiary bombs rained down on the population. </p>
            <p>Flames consumed towns and villages, and black smoke covered the sky. </p>
            <p>The two sisters begin to talk, piecing together their remaining memories. </p>
            <p>"There was an air raid shortly after we arrived in Nakijin from Minamidaito Island, and we didn't even have time to unpack our bags. The air raids continued from about 7:00 in the morning into the evening, and much of our village was burned to the ground."</p>
            <p>"Japanese army? No, there was no resistance. It was just a one-sided attack by the US." </p>
            <p>My mother interrupts his words. </p>
            <p>“It was on October 10, the day of the air raid, that Yoshiko died, coughing up blood. She had been suffering from an illness for a long time... No, she was not killed by a bullet. She died of shock, vomiting blood. Our family didn't even prepare an air-raid shelter because there were only my grandmother and Yoshiko, who was sick, in Nakijin, so we didn't dig an air-raid shelter.” </p>
            <p>“How old was my grandmother at that time, Yoneko?” </p>
            <p>“Well, she would have been sixty-six years old..." </p>
            <p>Atsuko leaned forward. </p>
            <p>“Toshio, if you remember, as you crossed the village hall toward Jana, you saw a small river running on your left. Our family escaped to the Tonuka Cave across from there.” </p>
            <p>Confirming the ages of their family members at that time, Yoneko and Atsuko said they were all young. </p>
            <p>“My brother Okiyoshi was 22 years old when he was taken away by the army and remained in the Northern Branch. Okinori was 14, I was 12, Atsuko was 8, Fumiko was 6, Yoshiyasu was 3, Toshio was 2, and Chieko hadn't been born yet.”</p>
            <p>“It is rare that no one was missing in that world of war.” </p>
            <p>My mother mumbled and clasped her hands together. </p>
            <p>Suddenly, I remembered my father. My gaze turned to the altar. </p>
            <p>My father, who always referred to the Self-Defense Forces as the Japanese Army, never wanted to visit the Minamidaito Islands again. Sometimes he murmured that he wished the war had never happened.</p>

        <h2 id="single-file-line-up*">Single File Line Up</h2>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>The year 1945 dawned with another air raid by the U.S. military. </p>
            <p>Air raids were carried out repeatedly. Particularly, on March 23, thousands of U.S. aircraft flew over the skies of Okinawa. The Grumman planes swooped down so low that the residents could distinguish the faces of American soldiers, and they were so thorough that they sought out moving targets and machine-gunned them. </p>
            <p>Airstrikes shook the land, incendiary bombs filled the air, and the ship's shells blew away trees. The residents felt as if they could even hear shouts of the American soldiers coming ashore.</p>
            <p>"Aha, Yoneko sister. The sea from Bisezaki to Kouri Island was lined with American warships as if they were building rafts." </p>
            <p>Yoneko sister chimed in, shrugging her shoulders as she continued her story.</p>
            <p>"There was naval gunfire both day and night. We even ran away from the Tonuka Cave because the Americans might land soon. Then we climbed up Mt. Kusunokiyama. My father was the first to go. Then my grandmother. I carried Yoshiyasu on my back, followed by Atsuko and Fumiko. Then my mother took Toshio, and my brother Okinori was the last. This single-file line of family members continued until the end of the war." </p>
            <p>"The bombardment? Toshio, you saw the Gulf War on TV, didn't you? It was exactly the same. A multi-layered band of light from a ship comes toward the island. The mountains are blown away as the sound of the air rupturing reaches your ears. ...When the gunfire starts, 'Here they come, take cover!' Everyone obeyed our father's loud voice." </p>
            <p>"Sis, our father's voice was loud at that time. Each one of us would lean against the trunk of a big camphor tree to avoid the bombardment."</p>
            <p>"Atsuko would be eight and Fumiko six. Thinking about it now, how could they all be so brave, not even crying... The mountains were shaking, and camphor leaves fell down silently. Shivering, you cling to the trunks on the opposite side from where shells are flying." </p>
            <p>"As soon as the artillery fire was over, the scout planes flew in low overhead. I still remember the sound of their engines as they buzzed over the mountains. The gunfire and reconnaissance planes would take turns. My body was shaking, but somehow my mind was cool." </p>
            <p>"The roof was thatched with tree branches, and the inhabitants were clustered here and there, hiding. Toshio cried a lot! We got kicked out many times by the people with whom we were hiding with because they said that if you started crying, the Americans would find us."</p>
            <p>My mother interrupted my sisters' story. </p>
            <p>“I didn't even get my boobies because there was nothing to eat,” she said.</p>
            <p>“Toshio cried because he was so hungry, he had no choice but to start cry. Our family was driven out of there, and we had to run around among the ship's guns.... It was about that time of year when the Rubus sieboldii Blume berries were ripe, and Toshio used to eat them a lot. He would finally stop crying when I put a strawberry in his mouth. It must have been about ten days since we hid in the mountains. The uncle from the east was with us, but you were crying so much that he strongly urged me to silence you by silencing you with this rag in your mouth.” </p>
            <p>Tears fell from my mother's eyes. </p>
            <p>“War even ruins the human heart... I couldn't do such a thing...” He was furious. He slammed down that rag on me... </p>
            <p>Mother stared at her hand for a moment, then continued, shaking her head.</p>
            <p>He said, ‘If I go with you guys, they will find me and kill me.’ He ran off... Just then, I thought I felt the earth shake, and suddenly I heard his voice crying. 'Iha's father, please give me some water! Please help me!’ There was nothing I could do. His scream didn't last long.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>When their mother's story breaks, it brings back the war in the eyes of my sisters, who were girls. </p>
            <p>"Sister Yoneko, the American artillery fire was very accurate. That's why we had to move as soon as the guns stopped. People didn't understand why the flares were being launched. When the flares went up, it was as bright as daylight. People would start moving around by that light, so it was like telling the U.S. where we were from all the way over there..." </p>
            <p>"Atsuko, was it when we were going down to Goga Mountain? In the hollows of the mountain path, soldiers and residents were blown off the torsos, their arms and legs were shredded, and crying out, ‘Help me! I'm in pain!’ Blue flames were still burning from their bodies, but there was nothing we could do..." </p>
            <p>“Our father's voice was loud. “'Single file! Don't look around! Look ahead, only ahead!”</p>
            <p>“Japanese Army soldiers? No, they were not protecting the local population. In fact, they even took away their food. They took off their uniforms and ran among the civilians. It got especially bad after the Americans landed in April… Some families were suspected of espionage and were cut down and killed by the Japanese forces. They were all innocent. And their corpses were exposed for a long time as examples to the residents... </p>
            <p>The residents were forced to evacuate Oppayama due to repeated and intense bombardment. They were gradually driven into dugouts near villages and the Kamekou tomb."</p>
            <p>On April 20, the northern area of Okinawa Prefecture was completely overrun by US forces. At the same time, the cry of 'Come out, come out!' rang out from everywhere in the mountain fields as the U.S. forces intensified their operations to scatter and find the enemy.</p>
            <p>"As we huddled together in the Kamekou tomb, we first saw American boots in the bright light. Then a black muzzle was pointed inside. Then, driven by the voice of 'Come out, come out,' we were all pulled out of our shelters and graves. The inhabitants went out with their hands in front of their faces... They were held at gunpoint, and everyone was lined up in rows to determine if they were civilians or soldiers."</p>
            <p>Sister Yoneko's voice, which had been speaking plainly up to this point, became higher.</p>
            <p>"Then something terrible happened. Mom, that was father's belt, wasn't it? He was wearing a soldier's belt, and they pulled him forward... They suspected that he was a soldier. Three American soldiers surrounded him, and one of them tried to pull the trigger. Then two of the soldiers rushed in to stop him."</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>"No! Not army! They're all babies, so small!" </p>
            <p>"He almost got shot... Then two soldiers gave him hand signals to remove his belt and throw it away... They threw away father's belt." </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>"Were all American soldiers good? No, not necessarily. Once, a pimple-faced soldier came and pulled mom out at gunpoint. The mother was still young, so he threatened her to follow him. The American soldier tried to force Toshio, who was being carried on her back, to get down. 'Gah!' Then the American soldier suddenly screamed and ran back in a hurry... </p>
            <p>Toshio bit the American soldier on the nose. Toshio saved my life." </p>
            <p>My mother giggled and burst into laughter.</p>
            <p></p>

<section class="sub-chapter row justify-content-center">
        <h2 id="tonuka-cave">Tonuka Cave</h2>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>"Why do the sand piles that Toshio makes have streaks in them? You need to make a better triangular mountain!" </p>
            <p>Yasuo became angry, behaving like a childish general. </p>
            <p>No matter how many times I tried to make a sand mountain, a line would form all the way to the top where my crooked little finger of the left hand struck it, and I just could not make a sand mountain without streaks. </p>
            <p>"I remember when Toshio was in the third grade. When I watched him running from behind, I noticed that he had a peculiar way of running with his left toe down."</p>
            <p>Based on my own memories and those of my family, I would guess that I contracted leprosy around the age of eight or nine. Considering the incubation period, I would say that I was infected when I was one or two years old. </p>
            <p>I was eager to find out the source of my own infection. </p>
            <p>"Grandma, did any of our close relatives have the same disease as mine?" "No, none of them." </p>
            <p>"What about our next-door neighbors?" </p>
            <p>"No, none of them." </p>
            <p>Suddenly, my mother started speaking strangely.</p>
            <p>"Toshio fell ill in Tonuka Cave... We had no choice but to flee to Tonuka Cave because we had just returned from Minamidaito Island and couldn't dig our own air-raid shelter. The entire village warned us, 'Iha's father, you will be in big trouble. Putting such small children in that cave, it was a leprosy patients' home'... We had no other option as there were no air-raid shelters available for us to seek refuge in... Until ten days before our family entered the cave, there were people suffering from leprosy in this cave, but the soldiers came and took them away to Yagaji. In Tonuka Cave, there were still some rags that they had used. That's when I made you crawl naked in a cave." </p>
            <p>My mother refers to people with leprosy using the terms 'Buddhist saint' and 'blood sick."</p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>My mother's story is connected to the following events: In 1944, Commander Ushijima of the Japanese Army mobilized the troops under his command to hunt down leprosy patients throughout Okinawa. This action was triggered by the discovery of leprosy patients who happened to be living in hiding in Commander Ushijima's General Staff Headquarters quarters, which had been taken over. The military-led hunt for leprosy patients began in May 1944 and concluded on September 21. This operation encompassed the entire island of Okinawa and was conducted with such thoroughness that it resembled a military campaign. During this time, Okinawa Airakuen, a public sanatorium for leprosy patients, had a fixed capacity of 430 beds. However, the number of patients admitted to the sanatorium increased to more than doubled to 913 as a result of this hunt.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>When my mother told me that Tonuka Cave was an infected area, I responded by stating that it was not possible. However, I proceeded to list the conditions of leprosy transmission one by one. First, there had to be a nearby patient shedding germs. Second, there had to be repeated contact between that person and my skin. And third, it could not be transmitted through the air. </p>
            <p>In response to my explanation, my mother posed several questions. </p>
            <p>"Well, what about that time?" </p>
            <p>"There must have been a patient near me who transmitted the disease, so please try to remember." </p>
            <p>"No, no one transmitted leprosy to you!" </p>
            <p>During this exchange, my mother did not use the word "infected" to describe the disease; instead, she used the phrase "pass it on." </p>
            <p>"Ah, she is scolding me for my foolishness in using different dialects, hovering on the boundary between illness and the one who was ill..." </p>
            <p>Then my mother gazed at me and said, "It's because of the war!"　</p>
