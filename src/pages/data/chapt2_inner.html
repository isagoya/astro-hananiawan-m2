        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>In October 1955, eagle hawks were crossing the clear sky in formation. </p>
            <p>My brother and I had just returned from a sports day practice and were engrossed in baking sweet potatoes in the livestock feeder at the back of the house.</p>
            <p>"We had to shovel out the ashes from the hearth, or the fire wouldn't burn," my brother said as he shoveled the ashes out with a fire shovel. "Two for each of us, right? I need to cover them well,"</p>
            <p>Suddenly, my older brother screamed, "Toshio! Your shoe is on fire! Your shoe..."</p>
            <p>Smoke was coming out of my left shoe. I looked at my brother who was shouting and pouring water on it, "Oh, my shoe is on fire. My left foot..."</p>
            <p>But I had a strange feeling. It neither hurt nor felt hot, I was carried to Ishikawa's clinic, and when I saw the panic of the doctors and nurses who were treating me, I cried out for the first time.</p>
            <p>"It hurts, it hurts," </p>
            <p>I cried, but it felt strange. I could see the scissors tearing at his shoes and cutting the skin on the soles of my feet, but I could not feel any pain.</p>
            <p>It took until May of the following year for this burn to fully heal. </p>
            <p>My body began to feel strange. The nerves in my body started to reverse, and pain began to surge through my body. The pain would strike day and night. No matter which part of my body was touched, an electric pain would shoot through my head.</p>
            <p>In December, the clinic director began to nod his head. </p>
            <p>"Father, maybe this kid's condition isn't a normal disease," he said. </p>
            <p>An unfamiliar word reached my ears as they whispered to each other. </p>
            <p>"Yagaji, Leprosy..."</p>
            <p>"No one in my family has this disease!" I heard my father's voice loudly denying.</p>
            <p>The director of Ishikawa Clinic started to show confusion regarding my treatment.</p>
            <p>He said, "I will refer you to Fukumoto Hospital in Goya. Please go there." </p>
            <p>Goya is in Koza City (now Okinawa City), about a 30-minute bus ride from Ishikawa City, where we live. </p>
            <p>My father, who had stopped growing when I was about the height of a lower elementary school student, carried me on his back and continued to take me to the hospital every other day. Meanwhile, I stayed home and read books and newspapers every day. </p>
            <p>One day, as I was casually flipping through the newspaper, the words "Yagaji," "Airakuen," and "leprosy" jumped out at me. I read the article again, devouring it. </p>
            <p>"Ah!" </p>
            <p>The "Yagaji" that the director had mentioned was the name of a place called "Yagaji!" </p>
            <p>Strangely enough, I was instantly convinced that my disease was leprosy. </p>
            <p>However, the diagnosis and treatment at Fukumoto Hospital were based on the disease name "childhood neuritis," and no declaration of "leprosy" was made.</p>
            <p>To stop the severe pain, "Irgapirin" injections began to be given. Each time, my father paid 200B yen in cash (B yen, the currency under the U.S. military regime, was used from 1948 to September 1958. The exchange rate was 1 dollar = 120B yen = 360 yen). This was at a time when the monthly salary of the Ryukyu government chief was 24,000B yen. </p>
            <p>Every day, 200B yen was paid like water. Even as a child, I was struck by the weight of this cash. </p>
            <p>I am not sure if it was the effect of this injection, but the pain that had been running through my body until then began to disappear. On the other hand, the sensation in both of my hands from the elbows to the tips of my fingers gradually disappeared. Additionally, my fingers on both hands began to bend toward the palm side, and both wrists lost their power to lift toward the back of my hands and became droopy.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>It was May, and I was thirteen years old. </p>
            <p>My father's back was sweaty, and his scent filled my nostrils as I waited for the bus on his back.</p>
            <p>Now!! I have to say it now, I have to say it soon... </p>
            <p>This impulse was pushing me up. </p>
            <p>"Dad, Dad, okay, let's not do this anymore. Don't spend the money! You shouldn't spend it... My disease can't be cured at this hospital now. I have to go to Yagaji to be cured!" </p>
            <p>When I finished saying all this at once, I burst into tears. I could feel my father's surprise through his arms as he shuddered. Then, without saying a word, he tightened his hands together again and suddenly left the bus stop, crossed Route 13 in a short run, and entered the block factory site. </p>
            <p>My father lowered me onto the block. </p>
            <p>The block factory in the late afternoon was neatly lined with only half-dried blocks and not a soul in sight. </p>
            <p>"Toshio! Who told you that...? Who told you...? Though you're a child... you're just a kid..." </p>
            <p>My father's slap stung my cheek. Tears streamed from my father's eyes as he continued to slap my cheek. </p>
            <p>Through my tear-blurred eyes, I could see the Erythrina variegata overhanging the fence. Over my father's shoulder, I could clearly see the red petals of it.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>I was supposed to return to the first grade of junior high school in October 1956. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, come here," </p>
            <p>my homeroom teacher, Ms. Nakama Tomi, called out during recess. Ms. Tomi repeatedly massaged my small, bent hands as if enveloping them in her own. This scene continued until March of the next year. I could feel the warmth from Ms. Tomi, but somehow my heart remained cold. </p>
            <p>"She is wasting her time...." </p>
            <p>There is no way to confirm if Dr. Fukumoto recommended it, but electrotherapy was added as a new after-school routine. However, instead of restoring the functions of my limbs, the treatment further deprived me of them. </p>
            <p>On April 30 of the following year, a regular group medical examination was held at Ishikawa Junior High School. </p>
            <p>After completing my medical examination, the school doctor began shaking for some reason. He dipped his hands deep into the disinfectant and raised his voice as he scrubbed his hands. </p>
            <p>"Call the health department and bring the parents here as soon as possible!" Contrary to the panic of those around me, my heart was filled with a sense of relief.</p>
            <p>"Finally..." </p>
            <p>A few days later, my desk and chair were burned in a corner of the playground. </p>
            <p>My mother still sometimes mentions it with regret. </p>
            <p>"I resent it. At least, I wanted them to set them on fire when the students weren't watching..."</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>On May 1, following instructions from the health center, I had an appointment for medical treatment at Koza Central Hospital.</p>
            <p>At six a.m., I tied a rope to the beam of the outdoor latrine. I was just about to lift myself up and hang my head. </p>
            <p>Fumiko, my sister, pounded on the bathroom door. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, hurry up! How long are you going to stay in there?" </p>
            <p>"Ah... I couldn't do it..." </p>
            <p>I quickly untied the rope. I wrapped it around my waist, covered it with my shirt, and then switched latrines with my sister. </p>
            <p>The pillar clock at the central hospital struck 9:00 a.m. </p>
            <p>I was undressed in the examination room, but a certain determination had already taken hold in my chest, and the surroundings vanished from my sight. I was fixated on the doctor's nameplate, which read, "Isamu Tajiri, a doctor invited by the Ryukyu government."</p>
            <p>"I am sorry, but I am sure it is leprosy." </p>
            <p>The doctor clearly told my father. </p>
            <p>"I will contact Airakuen and ask him enter there tomorrow. Toshio-kun, how old are you? Okay, you're 14 years old. If you are treated now, you will surely recover." </p>
            <p>My father did not say a word until we reached home. </p>
            <p>Only my grandmother was waiting for us at home, with the altar in front of her. </p>
            <p>My father, sitting upright in front of my grandmother, quietly opened his mouth. </p>
            <p>"Tomorrow, I will take him to Airakuen." </p>
            <p>My grandmother, having finished listening to my father, uttered a scream that bordered on a scream. </p>
            <p>"There is no one in my family with this disease!" </p>
            <p>Then she got up with a loud cluck of her tongue and passed in front of me without saying a word. </p>
            <p>My grandmother was still proud of her samurai family, the Iha family, as she used to say. At that moment, the only thing she had ever been proud of, even after the fall of her family, was shattered when her grandson got diagnosed with leprosy.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>"Toshio, come here and sit down..." </p>
            <p>My father sat me down in front of the Buddhist altar. Then he took out a vermilion-lacquered sansin (shamisen) box from the back of the closet. </p>
            <p>The strings of this sansin had been cut four years before by my father himself, who was proud of his local chant. The reason for this was that his second son, Okinori, who was 22 years old, had taken his own life in August 1953. </p>
            <p>The death of his proud son, who had passed the initial public examination for the newly established University of the Ryukyu, devastated his father. </p>
            <p>When my father finished stringing the instrument, he took a deep breath.</p>
            <p>Then he began to chant in a low, long, muffled voice. My grandmother leaned her back against a pillar and listened. </p>
            <p>"Makotoka... jichika... wa... chimu... furi... burrito..." </p>
            <p>As a 14-year-old boy, it was all I could do to memorize the lyrics of the chant from my father's chant. </p>
            <p>Using this faint memory as a clue, I searched for the chant from that time. It was 40 years later that I finally found it.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>"Big brother, I'm looking for some Ryukyuan poetry. Can you show me a good book?" </p>
            <p>"Then, this is the most detailed one." </p>
            <p>The book he handed me was "Ryukashu" (Ryukyu Poetry Anthology), written by Seibin Shimabukuro. </p>
            <p>I decided to track down a song that began with "Makotoka." Memory was only a thin thread. </p>
            <p>"Makotoka... jichika..." </p>
            <p>"Ah, there it is! Here it is!" </p>
            <p>----Is this true, my mind awakes with a smile and dreams of amazement. </p>
            <p>It was labeled "Sanyamabushi”. </p>
            <p>"This is it... This must be it. I finally found it..." </p>
            <p>The song was accompanied by a note saying that the place where the song was to be sung must be strictly observed. </p>
            <p>"Big brother, I'd like to hear a Sanyamabushi." </p>
            <p>"You want to hear a rare song, not often played. What's wrong?" </p>
            <p>"Why is it rarely played?" </p>
            <p>"Because it's a farewell song." </p>
            <p>My brother selects out this song from a CD. </p>
            <p>The pause in the strings was accompanied by a breathless chant that filled the room with an intense atmosphere. </p>
            <p>...There was no doubt. It was this "Sanyamabushi" that my father had chanted. </p>
            <p>...The image of my father from that time comes back to me from the depths of my memory. </p>
            <p>The "Sanyamabushi" pierces my memory of that time. </p>
            <p>I wonder if what is happening now is real, and if it is, I hope it is just a waking dream. </p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>The shutters remained closed. </p>
            <p>The family circle, with me in the center, was quiet. I just stared at the small furoshiki wrapping cloth that my mother had prepared for me. </p>
            <p>My mother was not part of this circle. She stood alone, facing backward, her shoulders shaking. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, let's go!" </p>
            <p>My father's short voice broke the silence of the morning on May 2, 1957. </p>
            <p>Atsuko, my sister, came near my knees and fixed my collar. </p>
            <p>Suddenly, fear rushed over me. I ran and clung to the pillar, crying out. The room was filled with the sound of my cries mixed with my screams. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, stop crying!" </p>
            <p>My father's exhortation put an end to it all. </p>
            <p>The bus ride from my home to Nago takes about an hour, but strangely enough, my memory of this time has completely slipped away. It is as if the boy's fear had erased even his memory, leaving it blank. The curtain of memory only opens at Nago Town (now a city), the bus transfer point to Yagaji Island. </p>
            <p>The sweet smell of gasoline fills the bus station, and the whistles that guide the buses are blaring. Only the depots for Naha-bound and Ishikawa-bound buses were particularly busy, with lines of people waiting and crowding. The leaves of the Fukugi trees planted in the windbreak shine as if embracing the morning sun. </p>
            <p>My father glanced at the timetable pinned above the "Shimabukuro Futon Shop" sign and muttered, "6:45 a.m." </p>
            <p>"Is the train to Yagaji at 45? One ticket for adults and one for an elementary school student to Yagaji, please." </p>
            <p>My father leaned over the counter to buy a ticket. It was the usual thing. I was so small that I could have been mistaken for a lower grade elementary school student, and that day I also an elementary school student’s ticket.</p>
            <p>A man with a bag on his lap, my father, and I were the only three people sitting at the tin-roofed bus stop. Under a chair in the corner, a family of four cats was playing with each other. A small cat with a blackish coat repeatedly jumped on and held down the parent cat's paw, which was lying down. </p>
            <p>The bus showed up just in time for departure, but only three people boarded the bus. </p>
            <p>A female conductor with a braided head inserted a pair of scissors into the two tickets offered by my father in a very familiar manner. My father lightly nodded to the male passenger who boarded first and seated me in the back seat by the window. </p>
            <p>The bus arrived on time, but the door to the boarding gate remained open for a while. The vibration of the engine could be felt from my seat. From time to time, a warm breeze came in from outside the window. </p>
            <p>The conductor's beeping whistle signaled the closing of the doors. The driver spoke to the conductor as he started the bus. </p>
            <p>He said, "Mamoru didn't get on. Was something wrong?" </p>
            <p>The conductor said, "Yesterday he said there was a funeral tomorrow." </p>
            <p>They were talking about a passenger who always gets on the bus. </p>
            <p>The bus finally departed when the clock on the bus ticket office showed five minutes before seven o'clock. </p>
            <p>The bus continued to run without a single passenger except for us, but finally, an elderly woman got on at Taira. She was carrying a heavy bunch of bananas in her hand. </p>
            <p>The conductor, holding the old woman's hand, made her sit in the first seat on the left side. </p>
            <p>"Auntie, how far are you going?" </p>
            <p>"To Yagaji. I have a great-grandson. It's a great achievement. We have a baby boy." </p>
            <p>"Congratulations on your baby boy. Auntie, don't drop your ticket. Put it in your wallet." </p>
            <p>The bus stopped in front of Haneji Elementary School, and a male passenger who had boarded the bus at Nago got off while talking to the driver. </p>
            <p>"I'll be on duty tonight, so I won't be riding tomorrow." </p>
            <p>"Okay, see you at..." </p>
            <p>The bus crossed the Yagaji Bridge. </p>
            <p>At the bus stop at the end of Yagaji Island, several people were waiting in line to catch the bus back to Nago. </p>
            <p>"Please be careful on your way." </p>
            <p>The conductor called out to an elderly woman who was leaving at a quick pace.</p>
            <p>"Thank you." </p>
            <p>After a while, my father asked a fisherman who was mending his nets under an Indian-almond tree about the way to Airakuen. </p>
            <p>"After a while, the road splits into two, so take the one on the right, and you will soon reach the main gate of Airakuen. Are you there to see someone?" </p>
            <p>My father, who thanked him, responded only vaguely to the fisherman's question. </p>
            <p>We walked for fifteen minutes to reach the fork in the road that the fisherman had mentioned. The white road on the right was flanked by sugar cane fields as tall as me. Occasionally, the wind would blow across the sugar cane fields. </p>
            <p>My father remained silent. I walked behind him, alternating between looking at his back and his feet. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, you have a lot of brothers and sisters... They are all still young..." </p>
            <p>he said without looking back at me. </p>
            <p>"Yes,” </p>
            <p>I replied, although the meaning of his words was unclear to me. It was not until 14 years later that I understood the true meaning of his words. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>A row of one-story houses was lined up on both sides, filled with the sweet fragrance of the oleander flowers. Soon, a concrete gatepost appeared in front. On the right side of the gatepost was a plaque reading "Okinawa Airakuen." </p>
            <p>At the reception of the main building, my father announced his intention to visit. </p>
            <p>A man said, "Ah, Mr. Iha, isn't it? I have heard about your visit. It must have been a long day since early in the morning. I'll inform everyone..." </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>After a short wait, a middle-aged man led the way, and we followed him to a tall gray wall with rough pebbles mixed in. Inside the gate, three men were already waiting for us. </p>
            <p>"Please come to the doctor's office at 9:00 a.m., Mr. Kishimoto. The doctor will be there for a checkup. Then, Father, please stop by the office later." </p>
            <p>The guide said and retraced his steps. </p>
            <p>"Nice to meet you. I am Furumi Eiichi. I am the head of the community association. This is Mr. Kishimoto Masao, the head of the boys' dormitory, and this is Mr. Taba Morikichi, a teacher at the school. Let's talk in the visiting room instead of standing around..." </p>
            <p>In the visiting room inside the wall, a long, narrow desk and chairs were arranged in two horizontal rows. </p>
            <p>The explanation to my father did not take long. After the explanation was over, the dorm father said, "We have been contacted by the main office of Airakuen. Please be advised that your son's name will be changed from today. The reason for changing the name to a false name is to avoid any negative repercussions on relatives... Mr. Tajiri has chosen a good name for your son." </p>
            <p>"...Thank you," my father said. </p>
            <p>"It is Sekiguchi Susumu. It's a Yamato name, but it's a good name." </p>
            <p>He unfolded the folded piece of paper and showed it to my father. </p>
            <p>It was written in black ink, "Susumu Sekiguchi." </p>
            <p>Mr. Furumi said, "There is nothing to worry about. We will take care of your son. Please visit him from time to time." </p>
            <p>My father stared at me silently and did not get up from his chair. </p>
            <p>"It's just that the sentiment will remain. Let's go." </p>
            <p>He finally stood up and bowed deeply. </p>
            <p>"Well, thank you." </p>
            <p>"Toshio, I will be back soon..." </p>
            <p>The end of the sentence was too soft to be heard. </p>
            <p>From inside the gate, I watched my father leave with a rounded back. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>In the examination room, a doctor and nurse were waiting for me, wearing masks and protective gowns. </p>
            <p>"Come, sit here. How's your new name? Isn't it nice? Susumu Sekiguchi, is it? Susumu." </p>
            <p>"Oh!" </p>
            <p>On the doctor's chest was the nameplate of "Tajiri Isamu" whom I had met yesterday.</p>

            <p>The boys' and girls' house to which I was shown was a two-story block building. </p>
            <p>"I'll introduce you to the kids when they come back at noon. I will get the school supplies for you, so wait here." </p>
            <p>With these words, the dorm father left the room. I was sitting alone in a room just up the stairs. A rush mat and two blankets were neatly folded in front of me, and on top of them were a set of toiletries and a furoshiki wrapping cloth. </p>
            <p>I heard someone coming up the stairs. However, the sound was a little strange. It was mixed with a metallic sound, and it was also slow. The creaking continued for a while, and then stopped. It repeated about four times. </p>
            <p>A strange-looking visitor appeared in front of me. I could not clearly hear the words spoken to me, but I returned the greeting. </p>
            <p>"Hello." </p>
            <p>The visitor sat down in front of me, and at the same time, with a pop, a pop, he took off both of his legs. From the knees down, they were artificial legs made of tin. </p>
            <p>(Oh...) </p>
            <p>I gulped and held my breath. </p>
            <p>His mouth was twisted, drool glistening at the edges. With his almost fingerless hands, he held a tennis ball-sized piece of sata andagi (Okinawan brown sugar tempura). </p>
            <p>"Did you come out early this morning?" I thought he had asked me that. </p>
            <p>"Yes, I did..." </p>
            <p>I replied with all the courage I could muster. </p>
            <p>"I see. Could you tell me your name? Where did you come from?" he asked. </p>
            <p>"From Ishikawa City. My name is Toshio Iha..." I answered. "Uh, Iha? Isn't that your real name? Didn't you get a new name?" he also asked. </p>
            <p>"Oh, yes, I did," I said. </p>
            <p>"Right? From now on, you must answer with your new name, no matter who asks you." </p>
            <p>"Yes... I was told my name is Susumu Sekiguchi." </p>
            <p>"I see. Susumu Sekiguchi... I guess you must have had an early morning coming from Ishikawa City. Are you hungry? Eat this." </p>
            <p>He handed me a Sata Andagi from his fingerless hand. It remained in my palm for a while. </p>
            <p>I could already taste the brown sugar and flour mixture that had always accompanied the festive meal. </p>
            <p>"Here, eat up." </p>
            <p>"Yes... No, I'm not hungry now, so I'll eat later." </p>
            <p>I was lying. The truth was frightening, and nausea was rising in the back of my throat. I just couldn't bring myself to eat the Sata Andagi. </p>
            <p>"Okay."</p>
            <p>The man didn't force me any further. </p>
            <p>“There would have been a church building in front of the gate. It is a house for prayers. Whenever you feel distressed, please visit me. I will always be there.” </p>
            <p>With these words, the man put his prosthetic feet back on and left the room. </p>
            <p>I couldn't move for a while. Sweat broke out on my neck and forehead. </p>
            <p>And I kept asking myself, “I can't believe I didn't eat what he gave me...” </p>
            <p>I heard a voice inside of me, blaming myself. </p>
            <p>“That's disgusting! I can't eat!” </p>
            <p>“From today on, you are just as sick as he is!” </p>
            <p>“No! No!” </p>
            <p>After a while, I ran upstairs to the bathroom, still clutching the Sata Andagi. </p>
            <p>The concrete toilet had an oval-shaped hole in it, and when I looked down, I could see a pale light shining from the ground-floor light fixture. </p>
            <p>I dropped the Sata Andagi into that hole. No, not dropped, I threw it away! </p>
            <p>It was falling like a thread. I felt like it took a very long time, as if it were falling into a deep... deep bottomless valley. </p>
            <p>I immediately burst into tears for no apparent reason. </p>
            <p>Suddenly, I was overcome with uncontrollable sadness. </p>
            <p>I'm an idiot, I'm an idiot. </p>
            <p>The voice of self-blame surged up from beneath my feet. I ran out of the room and headed for the church hall at once. </p>
            <p>In the front row of the quiet church, the man was praying alone. </p>
            <p>I hugged him and cried out loud. </p>
            <p>“I threw it away! I threw it away! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!” </p>
            <p>“What’s wrong? What happened? It's okay. It's okay now. You're an honest child... Come on, let's pray together. I have just been praying for a new friend.”</p>
            <p> My shrieking, weeping voice is absorbed into the dimly lit church hall. </p>
            <p>The man was Evangelist Keisai Aoki.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>He was ordained as a steward from 1893 to 1969 and was appointed steward in 1966. He was sent by Miss Ada Hannah Liddell, director of Kumamoto Kaishun Hospital, to evangelize leprosy patients in Okinawa in 1927 when he was 34 years old. The miserable conditions of the sick who had been driven from their villages and were living in caves made him realize that in order to truly help the sick, a land where they could live in peace was needed in addition to faith. He remained in Okinawa and continued to seek that place with his patients. </p>
            <p>On the mainland, five public leprosy sanatoriums had already been opened in 1909. Okinawa Prefecture, the poorest prefecture in Japan at the time, had more than three times as many leprosy patients as any other prefecture on the mainland. Despite this, since 1910, the authorities of Okinawa Prefecture had repeatedly promoted plans to establish sanatoriums, but each time a planned site came to light, it was met with fierce opposition by local residents, and despite the use of strong public authority, the establishment of sanatoriums had not been realized.</p>
            <p>Seeing the adversity of his sick friends in Okinawa, Master Aoki scrambled for a piece of land, even if it was only a few square meters, where he could provide a place of healing without being chased by anyone. Finally, he succeeded in purchasing a 9,900-square-meter plot of wilderness in Ufudoubaru, Yagaji Island, in the name of another person. On December 28, 1935, Master Aoki led his patients, who had been wandering aimlessly in the shadows of the night, to settle at Ufudoubaru, Yagaji Island.</p>
            <p>However, the place they arrived at did not become a haven of peace for the patients. They were repeatedly attacked by the residents, and their tents were continually torn down. They decided to build dugout huts, thinking that if they built huts on their own land, they would be protected by the police unlike the temporary tent huts. But their efforts were furtile in the face of the angry inhabitants. Even the huts were thrown into the sea. Master Aoki, as the ringleader, even had his life threatened.</p>
            <p>“Not even a single sparrow falls to the ground without God's permission. We just leave it all to God's heart.” </p>
            <p>“Find Aoki! Kill Aoki!” </p>
            <p>The voices of the residents echoed in the shadows of the night. </p>
            <p>“Father, forgive them.” Master Aoki prayed as he hid in the Screw pine.</p>
            <p>Three years later, he was finally rewarded for his life's work. In 1938, overcoming local opposition, the prefectural government decided to open Kunigami Airakuen on the Ufudoubaru property purchased by Master Aoki and the adjacent land owned by Okinawa MTL (Mission to Lepers - a Christian missionary and comforting organization for people affected by leprosy and raising awareness of leprosy), which had been purchased under the name of Pastor Danjiro Hattori.</p>

            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>In 1957, I met Evangelist Aoki, who had already lost both legs and fingers. It was as if he had exchanged his life for the salvation of leprosy patients in Okinawa, carrying the weight of the aftereffects of the disease all over his body. </p>
            <p>Evangelist Aoki and I prayed side by side. </p>
            <p>Later, I could only express my gratitude to him by joining my hands together at the “Monument of Honor of Keisai Aoki" adjacent to the ossuary. On the monument, his own haiku (Japanese short poem) is engraved.</p>
