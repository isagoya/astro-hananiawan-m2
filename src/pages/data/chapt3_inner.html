        <h2 id="paranku-plays-in-the-early-morning.">Paranku plays in the early morning.</h2>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>"Rat-tat, rat-tat, rat-tat!" </p>
            <p>It's 6 o'clock in the morning. The Paranku, a small hand-held Okinawan drum, is played by Tamotsu Ishigaki, echoes through the boys' and girls' houses. </p>
            <p>Every day, the children wake up to the sound of these drums. </p>
            <p>All four rooms in the boys' house on the second floor and the girls' house on the first floor become noisy at once. In room 4 of the boys' house, Asanori, a junior high school third grader, is by the window. Next to him is Teruo, an elementary school first grader. I, a junior high school second grader, am next to them, and beside me are Masakazu, an elementary school second grader, Yasuo, a junior high school first grader, and Yoshihiro, an elementary school fifth grader. Mitsuo and Kenyu, fourth graders, fill the room. </p>
            <p>The place near the room entrance for Mr. Nakamoto, who is the cook, is already empty. </p>
            <p>First, Asanori and I get up and fold up the green mosquito netting that is stretched across the 16-mat room. This is the role of the elders. </p>
            <p>When the lights go out, Masakazu starts crying. </p>
            <p>He cries, "Mom, I want to go home. Mommy." I am at my wits' end every night. </p>
            <p>I have no choice but to hold him in my arms and put him to sleep, and finally, he stops crying. </p>
            <p>Last night, Masakazu, who was still groggy, was lying on my bed with his back rounded. </p>
            <p>"Masakazu, wake up. Come on, the drums are playing. Stand up and raise your right leg." </p>
            <p>I start putting on the shirt and pants I had prepared the night before, calling out to him. After I finish dressing him, he doesn't seem to wake up. </p>
            <p>I have no choice but to sit Masakazu down at the desk, which is about 40 centimeters long and 60 centimeters wide, and put away the bedclothes for both of us in the closet. </p>
            <p>"Masakazu, here, take your toiletries..." </p>
            <p>Pulling on Masakazu's sleeve, we hurry to the washroom three rooms away. All of this has to be done in about 15 minutes. </p>
            <p>At the boys' and girls' houses, four people live and take care of the children: father Masao Kishimoto, mother Masako Minami, brother Tamotsu Ishigaki, and sister Taeko Shinjo. It is an unwritten rule that children in the second year of junior high school and above are assigned to share a room with a younger child and are responsible for their daily lives. I take care of Masakazu. It takes a lot of encouragement for Masakazu's giggles to make it in time for the radio calisthenics, which begin at 6:30 in the front yard. </p>
            <p>Twenty-four elementary school students and thirty-two junior high school students (33 boys and 23 girls) wash up and scatter around there. </p>
            <p>"Good morning," says Tamotsu, the dormitory brother. "Yasuo's group is on rabbit duty from this week. Norio's group will be on meal duty. I hope everyone is doing well today. Let's all be in good spirits today." He gives the usual confirmation before the radio calisthenics. This is how the fifty-six members of the group begin their communal life together. </p>
            <p>The number of rabbits kept in the air-raid shelter, which had been left untouched during the war as a valuable source of protein, had increased to 60, and the role of rabbit duty was assigned to mow grass and weeds for their food. The children who were not on duty were assigned to clean the garden and each room. This continued until breakfast at 7:15 after the radio exercises. </p>
            <p>After breakfast, the children sat at their desks with their textbooks open and studied until 8:00, just before going to school. </p>
            <p>"It's time to go to school," </p>
            <p>Father Kishimoto's voice rings out in the hallway. We head off to school together. </p>
            <p>Children suffering from leprosy studied at Sumii Elementary and Junior High School, located within the sanatorium. </p>
            <p>The school opened in 1951, but plans to open the school had run into a snag because the local board of education had not agreed to the school's opening. However, Yara Chobyo, the archipelago government's director of education (and former governor of Okinawa Prefecture), who was passionate about "educational opportunities for sick children," went so far as to amend a law that had been a barrier to opening Sumii Elementary and Junior High School, a school directly under government control. The school closed in 1980 when the number of children who had contracted the disease was reduced to zero. Today, the only mark of the school's existence is a monument left on the site of the school. </p>
            <p>The marble monument stands in a shady corner, and the school song is inscribed on it.</p>
            <p></p>
            <!-- <p class="spacer"></p> -->
            <pre>
    Hope and Confidence: Morning and evening. 
    Tell the message, and it will echo: The bells of the forest. 
    Friends, take hands and encourage each other, 
    And in rainy morning, even in the windy nights. 
    Let us pursue the path of learning.
            </pre>
            <p></p>

            <p>Embedded next to the school song is the bell that told the time to the children at the school. This bell was presented to Mr. Chobyo Yara when he was the president of the Okinawa Teachers Association, through a donation for the reconstruction of the war-damaged school. </p>
            <p>Since the school opened, a total of 390 elementary school students and 424 junior high school students have passed through its gate. </p>
            <p>Leprosy poses a high risk of infection among young children, and areas with a high incidence of leprosy tend to have a high percentage of juvenile cases. Conversely, the number of juvenile patients can be a barometer of the incidence of patients in an area. </p>
            <p>The number of children at Sumii Elementary and Junior High School was 106 in 1951. In 1986, there were 46. The number of students had dropped to zero by 1980. The closure of Sumii Elementary and Junior High School, which had a 30- year history, also marked the end of the leprosy outbreak in Okinawa Prefecture. </p>
            <p>At the time I became ill, Sumii Elementary and Junior High School had one principal and two teachers, one of whom was a qualified leprosy patient. </p>
            <p>As a matter of course, it was difficult to educate as many as 60 children with only three teachers and staff, including the school principal. As a solution, the salary of Ms. Chikako, a patient teacher undergoing treatment at the sanatorium, was donated to the school supporters' association, and the salary was divided equally among four patient assistant teachers to manage the school. </p>
            <p>The school had one class for elementary school and two classes for junior high school. </p>
            <p>Except for lunch and the 2:00 p.m. treatment, we stayed at the school until around 4:00 p.m. </p>
            <p>After dinner, everyone had free time until 7:00 p.m., when they made friends and played together. However, I, who had severe limb disabilities due to a permanent injury, did not like to play outside and spent most of the time reading books borrowed from school. </p>
            <p>From 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. was designated as evening study time, but Masakazu, an elementary school second grader, was forced to sit at his desk, crying. </p>
            <p>"Big brother, I studied in the morning, so there is nothing left to study now." </p>
            <p>The day would end with the lights going out at nine o'clock at night. Looking back, the days were indeed very regular. However, strangely enough, I have no memory of feeling cramped. Perhaps these three years were a fulfilling time for me. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>However, in my third year of junior high school, an unfathomable sense of anxiety overcame me. </p>
            <p>"What am I going to do now? How am I going to live?" </p>
            <p>I got out of bed and spent many nights alone on the rooftop. </p>
            <p>Finally, Kishimoto dorm father sat down next to me. He would just sit silently alongside me. </p>
            <p>"Susumu, you can't sleep, can you...? Can I join you? I also get bleary-eyed when I think about my family I left behind in Nago." </p>
            <p>It continued for about two months. That day, he was sitting next to me with both knees in his arms as usual. </p>
            <p>"Susumu, where did you paint in today's sketch session?" </p>
            <p>"The ossuary." </p>
            <p>"I see. The sea and the green forest there are both beautiful." </p>
            <p>"No, I did not paint nature. I drew only the entrance to the ossuary in detail on the entire sheet of paper." </p>
            <p>"What? Don't you think you should have included some of the surrounding scenery?" </p>
            <p>"I don't think so!" </p>
            <p>"...I received a review of the sketch session from the artist, Taira, who said, 'Next time I come to visit, I'll buy lots of brightly colored crayons.'" </p>
            <p>"No matter how many brightly colored crayons he brings, nobody uses those colors!" </p>
            <p>I cried, as cheekily as I could. I wanted to let out all the unidentifiable things that had been building up in my heart all at once. </p>
            <p>"Adults don't understand that children want to die." </p>
            <p>"You fool! Don't be so naive!" </p>
            <p>Kishimoto dorm father slapped me across the cheek.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>It was June 1958, the third year of junior high school. Ms. Setsuko Tokuda, my Japanese homeroom teacher, came into the classroom with a smile on her face. </p>
            <p>"Big news! I have big news! Mr. Yasunari Kawabata, the author of 'Izu no Odoriko' (The Dancing Girl of Izu), will be coming to Airakuen the day after tomorrow!" </p>
            <p>Ms. Setsuko was a newly graduated teacher who had been assigned to the school at the beginning of the school year. During class, she would get stuck on the tough questions I would ask her, and sometimes she would burst into tears. What had happened to her, who had always entered the classroom with a downcast look on her face? Today, she was excited. </p>
            <p>I had my own reasons for being mean. This past April, all the patient assisting teachers left the school at the same time Ms. Setsuko was appointed. If only Ms. Setsuko had not come... My belief was growing stronger by the day. It was a complete misunderstanding, but my sense of justice was compelling me to do it. </p>
            <p>She said, "Besides, I heard that he is coming all the way to the school. And since he would very much like to read your essays, he has been informed that we should deliver them to the hotel this evening. I will take them to him." </p>
            <p>The visit of Yasunari Kawabata, the President of the Japan Pen Club, to Okinawa had been all over the newspapers, and he had requested an unscheduled visit to Airakuen as well. Additionally, it was mentioned that he wanted to meet the children of Sumii Elementary and Junior High School. </p>
            <p>On June 8, before the start of school, I received a sudden call from Principal Yasuda. </p>
            <p>"Mr. Kawabata called me. He read Sekiguchi's essay and said, 'I would like to talk to him.' I will call you when he arrives, so please come to the staff room. Answer the questions he asks you clearly."</p>
            <p>I do not have the essay from that time, but from memory, I think I wrote it under the title of "An Ear of Rice." </p>
            <p>A creek, whose source of water is the Sumuide tribe, flows into a cove at the southern boundary of Airakuen. The area around the cove, where the river and the sea mix, is a mangrove forest. Right at the mouth of the creek, there was a weir and a sluice gate. It was also my favorite secret place.</p>
            <p>As I watched the creek from the sluice gate, a single rice plant with its ears still attached would flow in and get caught in the eddy at the edge of the weir. And it would repeatedly sink and floated up. I would stare at the scene, and before I knew it, I found myself cheering for the single ear of rice, saying, "Hang in there, hang in there." At the same time, I thought of my father's and mother's faces.</p>
            <p>I remember the main idea of the essay was something like this.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>The second period social studies class was coming to an end. Mr. Kawabata entered the classroom, escorted by the headmaster, Mr. Oyadomari, and the head nurse, Mrs. Chinen.</p>
            <p>"Everyone is studying very hard, aren't they?" he said, looking at each student's face and addressing us. However, his voice sounded thin and weak. He was the only one in the class not wearing a protective coat and still in plain clothes.</p>
            <p>After a while, Ms. Setsuko came to pick me up, saying, "Susumu-kun, come to the staff room. You know, answer clearly when you are asked." </p>
            <p>She repeated the same thing the principal had told me earlier. I kept my mouth shut and didn't answer.</p>
            <p>"Excuse me, this is Sekiguchi," </p>
            <p>I said as I stood still at the entrance to the staff room.</p>
            <p>"You must be Susumu Sekiguchi. Come on in and have a seat there," Mr. Kawabata said.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kawabata had large eyes and prominent cheekbones. His voice was high-pitched, like the common tongue, as if it were coming from a radio.</p>
            <p>"It was a good essay," he remarked, and then proceeded to ask me a few questions about the essay.</p>
            <p>"I understand you are fond of mangroves." </p>
            <p>"Yes, mangroves grow well in both fresh and salt water. When I feel weak, I go to look at the mangrove forests. There are moments when the forest shines. But this is something I can't tell you." </p>
            <p>"A secret?" </p>
            <p>He let out a small laugh. </p>
            <p>"Do you like books?" </p>
            <p>"Yes." </p>
            <p>"Have you read Tamio Hojo's 'The First Night of Life'?" </p>
            <p>"Yes." </p>
            <p>"Okay. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it," he said, pulling up his chair. </p>
            <p>"Although it's too difficult for me to understand everything, I could grasp some meaning when I read Tamio's letter in the afterword. But... Tamio's letter is sorrowful." </p>
            <p>"I see. Which part is that?" he also asked me. </p>
            <p>"Yes, 'For me, more than anything else, it was a question of life or death. It was more fundamental than literature.' The attitude toward life came next. 'If you can believe in people, you can endure. To believe in humanity or not to believe in humanity.'" </p>
            <p>These passages, which I had transcribed many times in my diary, came out smoothly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kawabata listened with tears in his eyes and a big nod of his head. Then a thin hand reached out and squeezed mine, but for some reason, I tried to pull my hand away. </p>
            <p>"You knew what he meant," he said. "You know the sadness of Tamio, of 'The First Night of Life'... You understood." </p>
            <p>He tapped my knee with his veiny hand. "Write a lot. Store a lot of it inside you," he said. </p>
            <p>"Mr. Kawabata, it is time to go," the director urged him. </p>
            <p>"Yes, I understand. We had a good talk today. Thank you... Sekiguchi-kun, is there anything you want?" </p>
            <p>"Books!" </p>
            <p>My voice was loud as I answered. </p>
            <p>Four weeks after our meeting, several cardboard boxes of books arrived.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>Breakfast on Sundays was one of my favorite things there. </p>
            <p>Each person was given four slices of bread, free refills of coffee from a commercial kettle, and a can of condensed milk for each room. </p>
            <p>Newspapers were spread out in the center of the room, and the children sat in a circle. Only on Sundays were we allowed to have breakfast in our own room. </p>
            <p>Two slices of bread were placed in front of each child, and condensed milk was dropped in swirls on top of the bread from the youngest to the oldest. The oldest child was responsible for this. All eyes were on it at once, and no one spoke up.</p>
            <p>"Let's eat!" </p>
            <p>As if we had been waiting for the eldest student's voice, all hands reached out at once, each receiving two more slices of bread from the center and eating them on top of each other. </p>
            <p>"It's delicious, big brother!" </p>
            <p>Teruo, a first grader in elementary school, was smiling broadly with his knees covered in milk. </p>
            <p>"Teruo, hold it properly with both hands. Look, the milk is dripping. You're going to get your pants dirty."</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>Every other Sunday was a day of eager anticipation for me. Around 10:00 a.m., I anxiously awaited the call from the office. </p>
            <p>"Susumu, you have a visitor." </p>
            <p>When I heard Father Kishimoto's voice, I ran out of my room. </p>
            <p>The visiting room was inside the sanatorium's walls, a 24-square-meter building with red tiles on top. </p>
            <p>My father and mother were sitting behind a long desk attached to the wall.</p>
            <p>"Toshio, how are you? Have you been doing everything all right?" </p>
            <p>My mother would always begin our visits with this question. Then she would take both my hands in hers and hold them close to her chest. My father's words were always the same. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, are you getting along with everyone? Are you listening to your dormitory father's advice?" </p>
            <p>"Yes," I answered. </p>
            <p>They must have left home early in the morning to get to Airakuen by this time. As they headed for the visitation area, people called out to them as they passed by. </p>
            <p>"Good morning, Iha's father. Where are you two going together?" </p>
            <p>"To the northern part of Okinawa."</p>
            <p>They never said, "To the leprosy sanatorium," but it was well known in the neighborhood where they were headed. </p>
            <p>"Poor things, they're going to Airakuen to visit their son again today, aren't they?" neighbors would have said. </p>
            <p>On the long table in the visiting room, tempura and sweets were already spread out. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, here, eat. There are enough for everyone, so share them with everyone later." </p>
            <p>My mother would only cry and whimper. </p>
            <p>"Pitiful. Such a small child." </p>
            <p>"That's why I don't like it. I hate it when my mother comes; all she does is cry. I'm the one who wants to cry. You came to cheer me up, didn't you?" </p>
            <p>After a while, I preferred to see my father alone. </p>
            <p>After that, my mother visited me much less frequently, and my father came alone more often.</p>

            <p>Summer vacation was almost upon us. </p>
            <p>The sheet made of tent fabric was spread out in the schoolyard, and Mr. Yoshiyuki Higa was disassembling the engine he had removed from his car. </p>
            <p>"In a four-cylinder engine, this piston compresses air and gasoline, which in turn causes repeated explosions. Here is the plug," he explained. </p>
            <p>Mr. Yoshiyuki's classes are always held in front of real objects. He talked about the structure of an engine, vaporization and explosion, and how energy is transmitted. I can still recall his teachings today, so it must have been a very easy-to-understand lesson. </p>
            <p>"Come on, let's put it together!" </p>
            <p>He urged the students. </p>
            <p>Seisuke, who was always a jovial fellow, was as jokable as ever. </p>
            <p>"Isn't Mr. Yoshiyuki's old engine not working anymore, so he's using the class as an excuse to get us to clean it out?" he said. </p>
            <p>"That's right, Seisuke. As always, don't be a fool and forget that screw." </p>
            <p>He reinstalled the engine and turned the key. </p>
            <p>Vroom-Vroom… </p>
            <p>There were holes all over the body of the car, and tinplate was stuck over the large holes. </p>
            <p>I could feel the engine revving in the body. </p>
            <p>"It's moving, it's moving!" </p>
            <p>Everyone cheered. </p>
            <p>"Everyone, be quiet. This summer vacation, we're going camping. August 18th." </p>
            <p>The children cheered again at Mr. Yoshiyuki's announcement.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>On the beach on the northern outskirts of Airakuen, the children were excited from the morning. Bathing in the sea, playing games, and eating outdoors, it was all new to them. </p>
            <p>As the sun set, around the blazing fire, everyone held hands and sang dormitory songs.</p>
            <p></p>
            <pre>
    In the flower garden of a small island, 
    We hold big hopes 
    that we can't contain within our young bodies. 
    Children of the wind, children of the rain, children of the light, 
    Sing, boys and girls in the dormitory.
            </pre>
            <p></p>
            <p>After singing the third in a series of dormitory songs, Father Kishimoto asked everyone to sit down in a loud voice. </p>
            <p>"Today, I would like to introduce a wonderful person to all of you. This is Mr. S, a senior student. He is a second-year student at Oku High School in Okayama Prefecture on the mainland. He is back in Okinawa for the summer vacation, so I asked him to come here and talk to all of you. Please be quiet and listen." </p>
            <p>Mr. S took off the student cap he was wearing and began to speak, tucking the cap under his arm. Every word that came out of his mouth was like lightning to me.</p>
            <p>- Naichi! (mainland) Okayama Prefecture! High school for lepers! Oku High School, Niirada Classroom! He was full of vigor. -- </p>
            <p>He concluded his speech by saying, "We are waiting for you."</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>From then on, Oku High School became my main concern. I went to the library, pulled out newspapers and publications, and wrote down relevant information. At the community association office, I read through the publications of the sanatorium on the mainland. </p>
            <p>I caught up with Mr. Kishimoto and Mr. Tokuda, the head of the community association, and bombarded them with questions. </p>
            <p>"How can I apply to Oku High School?" </p>
            <p>I was obsessed with Oku High School in Okayama Prefecture, as if I had a fever. And then I finally understood something.</p>
            <p>The minimum requirement to take the entrance examination was to be enrolled in a sanatorium on the mainland, and there was no such facility available in Okinawa. Therefore, first of all, I had to go to the mainland. And to do so, I needed a passport. </p>
            <p>I visited Tokuda's house many times since then. </p>
            <p>He said, "Unfortunately, Sekiguchi-kun, there is nothing we can do now. Okinawa is under U.S. administration. In addition, there are significant obstacles standing in the way, such as the Immigration Control Order, the Quarantine Law, and the Leprosy Prevention Law. It is difficult for leprosy patients to leave Airakuen, and it is almost impossible for us to cross over from Okinawa to mainland Japan...." </p>
            <p>No matter how many times I asked, the answer was the same. That day, I listened with my shoulders drooping. </p>
            <p>"... Sekiguchi-kun, you want to go to high school that much. Okay, then, I'll give you some wise advice. But don't take this as official advice. I'm just talking to myself. The barrier standing in the way of your dream of going to the mainland is the law. If you follow the law and it becomes an obstacle, then you need to break the law. Illegality is also a form of human wisdom, hahaha..." </p>
            <p>I was at a loss to understand the meaning of what Chairman Tokuda had just said because it was so difficult. </p>
            <p>He said, "Listen, Sekiguchi-kun, if being a leper is a barrier, why don't you stop being a leper for a while? If being in a leprosy sanatorium means being labeled as a patient, why not escape from Airakuen..." </p>
            <p>"Escape! Escape from Airakuen. I see," I was startled. </p>
            <p>"You're still Japanese. It is not right that the path to examination is closed for you just because you are an Okinawan resident. We will do our best. Your dreams will come true. To be prepared for that time, you must first improve your academic ability," he said. </p>
            <p>"Yes," I answered. </p>
            <p>The next day, I visited Evangelist Aoki for the first time in a while. </p>
            <p>"Please give me the leftover candles from the prayer candles. Don't throw them away from now on; give them all to me." </p>
            <p>I melted those candles and packed the wax in an empty can, and my lamp was ready to use. The desk was made from an empty somen (Japanese thin wheat noodles) box. </p>
            <p>The lower section of the closet with the bedding removed would be transformed into my study room after lights out. It was the best I could do. However, the closet door had to be closed to prevent the light from leaking out. I couldn't help but get soot all over my face as I began to study in the special room within the closet.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>As the second semester began, I wrote a letter. Unusually, I told them that I would like my mother to come alone for the upcoming visitation. I decided to speak to my mother first about this request. If I told my father first and he objected, there was no way I would ever again be able to reverse the conclusion that had been reached. So, by going through my mother, I was trying to avoid any foreseeable danger. </p>
            <p>When my mother visited on Sunday, I took her out to Scorebrand Park instead of the visiting room. </p>
            <p>I didn't want anyone to hear our conversation.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>Scorebrand Park is in the center of the sanatorium and is built around a small hill about 30 meters high. Scorebrand is the name of a person. Dr. Rolf von Scoresbrand served as the Director of Public Health for the U.S. Military Government from 1949 to 1952. </p>
            <p>His accomplishments are numerous. Notable among them are his donation to the reconstruction of the sanatorium after the war and his paving the way for special food distribution to patients in order to secure the 3,000 kilocalories needed daily for the treatment of leprosy with the special medicine Pro-Min medicine. </p>
            <p>At the top of the hill hangs the Bell of Confidence and Hope, a gift from the Neukorn Ironworks in Germany through his efforts. The bell weighs a massive 140 kilograms and is rung to signal the morning, noon, and evening time signals, as well as religious gatherings. </p>
            <p>In appreciation of his achievements, the patients have named the entire hill where the bell tower stands "Scorebrand Park." He spent the rest of his life in Okinawa, where his remains are enshrined in an ossuary in this sanatorium with those of his patients in accordance with his last will and testament.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>To reach the top of the park, walk through the flowerbeds and climb about 20 steps. Then, climb another 30 steps up a winding staircase that leads to the top of the park. </p>
            <p>I sat down on a bench next to my mother. </p>
            <p>"It's rare that Toshio wants me to come alone, so I won't cry today. The view from here is very nice," she said, looking at the surrounding area visible through the grove of pine trees. </p>
            <p>"Kouri Island looks so close from here..." As usual, my mother had prepared a feast in front of me. </p>
            <p>I was contemplating how to start the conversation when I made up my mind. </p>
            <p>"I will graduate from junior high school next March, and since Airakuen only goes up to junior high school, I won't be able to continue studying even if I want to. I want to study more and more. There is a high school where someone like me, who is ill, can study. It's located in Okayama Prefecture. So, after I graduate from junior high school, I want to go to Yamato! (the mainland of Japan) I want to go to Yamato... Mom, please ask Dad!" </p>
            <p>“……”</p>
            <p>There was no response from my mother; she kept her words to herself. </p>
            <p>"Please let me go to Yamato!" I repeated. </p>
            <p>My mother's previous declaration was shattered. She started crying again. </p>
            <p>"It's so far from here, and you still want to go far away. No." </p>
            <p>I was also desperate. It was the first time I cried in front of my mother. </p>
            <p>"Please let me learn more. If I don't, my future will be ruined," I pleaded. </p>
            <p>My initial attempt to persuade her failed. </p>
            <p>When my father came to visit me later, he never mentioned Yamato.</p>
            <p></p>

        <h2 id="school-for-the-seven">School for the Seven</h2>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Graduation was approaching, and I was becoming impatient as my plan to go to Yamato had made no progress. </p>
            <p>Out of the eight classmates (three boys and five girls) none were expected to recover from their illnesses and leave the school. Even some of my classmates seemed resigned to this fate.</p>
            <p>During homeroom, I addressed everyone, saying, "If things continue as they are, we will all have to move to the Youth House Maidens' Dormitory after graduation. However, the Youth House lacks a suitable environment for studying. What do you all think? Let's all stay in the Boys and Girls House for one more year and then assess if there is any way for us to continue our studies," </p>
            <p>I said. All seven agreed, except for Hatsue.</p>
            <p>"I don't want to study anymore. I hate studying," </p>
            <p>Hatsue expressed, choosing to leave the group. </p>
            <p>From that moment on, the remaining seven became serious. They stormed into the staff room and made their appeal, </p>
            <p>"Please let us continue studying at school, even if it's just in a corner of the classroom," we said. </p>
            <p>Our teachers responded, "That's not possible. The School Education Law does not permit special exceptions." </p>
            <p>We then suggested, "Then all of us should be given failing grades and be retained."</p>
            <p>Despite negotiations with the school administration, we failed to achieve a breakthrough. We turned to Father Kishimoto and Mother Minami, seeking their assistance. </p>
            <p>"Please help us find a way to continue our studies. Let us stay at the Boys and Girls House for just one more year," we pleaded. </p>
            <p>Both of them agreed, saying, "Alright, we will negotiate with you."</p>
            <p>Finally, a powerful ally emerged. The negotiating team, consisting of the seven students and the dormitory parents, resumed negotiations with the residents' association. </p>
            <p>Just before the graduation ceremony, the "Okay" was given, bringing joy and causing the seven students to celebrate by clasping hands.</p>
            <p>The president of the local association of patients, who was informed of the decision, had a broad smile on his face. </p>
            <p>"The seven will be allowed to continue living at the Boys and Girls House for one year after graduation. A vacant room in the first ward will serve as the classroom. The appointed teachers are Taba and Kinjo. Good luck!"</p>
            <p>Even teachers selected from among the patients were available. Thus, for the first time since the establishment of the sanatorium, a "preparatory school" was opened. </p>
            <p>We named this school "School for the Seven." </p>
            <p>It marked the beginning of the call for "Okinawa children to have the opportunity to pursue higher education!" and was the first step towards impressing Okinawans enrolled in sanatoriums on the mainland.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>However, despite my high expectations, progress was slow. </p>
            <p>In December 1959, while still a student at the School for the Seven, I made a direct appeal to my father to let me go to the mainland.</p>
            <p>"Toshio, do you desire to study so passionately? Your mother informed me about it. I understand. I forgive you... just ensure you gather all the necessary preparations," he said. </p>
            <p>I felt relieved as the burden on my shoulders eased.</p>
            <p>January 1960 arrived, and I was summoned to the cafeteria by Dormitory Father Mr. Kishimoto. </p>
            <p>He said, "I contacted Mr. Ishigaki from Kagoshima Prefecture's Hoshizuka Keiaien. Susumu, you have the chance to escape. But remember, don't tell anyone about this, okay?" </p>
            <p>He had always been concerned about the aftereffects of my hand and leg.</p>
            <p>"I wish I could send you, Susumu-kun, to study on the mainland of Japan. However, with your hands, you'll be discovered before boarding the ship," he often expressed. </p>
            <p>But today, Father Kishimoto was different from his usual self.</p>
            <p>"Do you want to give it a try?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, I'll run away!"</p>
            <p>The blood in my body rushed to the surface, filled with excitement.</p>
