        <p>The road from Okayama Station to Saidaiji Mushiake and Ushimado was mostly rural, and the regular bus service
            terminated at Mushiake, a fishing port the Seto Inland Sea. </p>
        <p>The National Sanatorium Nagashima Aiseien was accessible only by a special ferry from a small pier jutting
            out into Mushiake Bay. The liaison ship was divided into two sections, with the front section by the pilot's
            seat reserved for staff, and the rear section for patients and related personnel. </p>
        <p>The ship weaved its way through the forest of fish ponds and aquaculture rafts in the sea, heading for
            Nagashima. Nowadays, a bridge has been built and the islands are connected to each other, but at the time we
            entered the sanatorium, it was a place that could only be reached by a special ferry, as befitted a
            sanatorium built for the purpose of absolute isolation and eradication. </p>
        <p>There are two leprosy sanatoriums on Nagashima とる. Nagashima Aiseien is located on the east side of the
            island from the center and was opened in 1930. </p>
        <p>The Oku Komyoen, located at the western end of the city, was opened in 1938 and originally existed as the
            Sotojima Sanatorium in Osaka City. However, it was directly hit by Typhoon Muroto in 1934, resulting in
            devastation and loss of many victims. The sanatorium's reconstruction in Osaka was met with local
            opposition, so it was rebuilt in Nagashima, Okayama Prefecture, under a different name. </p>
        <p>The island where the leprosy patients who traded their lives for a lifetime live is undoubtedly breathtaking
            to outsiders who merely pass by and look at it, a land filled with white sand, green pine trees, and sky in
            the cove. </p>
        <p>The entrance and exit to Nagashima was Funakoshi Pier. Once off the boat, the road splits off to the left or
            right, but all patients take the path heading left. After 500 meters along the pine-lined road by the sea,
            one comes to the ivy-twined treatment building. From there onwards, the administrators call them patient
            zones. </p>
        <p>At a large camphor tree in front of the treatment building, the road splits in two. The road on the right
            extends along the coast of the Seto Inland Sea. Soon the large building of the public hall could be seen on
            the right. The road gradually rose to a toe, and after passing through a cut through a hillside, Shodoshima
            Island came into view in the distance through the branches of a pine tree. Soon we could see the reclaimed
            valley ground below us, but if we continued down the hill and headed along the coast, it would be a shortcut
            and take us to the back of the lodge. </p>
        <p>The high school was about 1.5 km away from the camphor tree in front of the treatment building. </p>
        <p>If we go over the ground instead of taking the road along the coast, we will come to the ruins of the
            elementary and junior high school buildings. Going down the hill from there, we will soon see the gate of
            Oku High School Niirada Classroom in front of the school. To the right of the school are three dormitories
            for boys, and up the hill to the left from the school gate is a separate dormitory for girls. </p>
        <p>There were 10 rooms in one of the men's dormitories, and the maximum number of students was three for one
            room, but those from the same sanatorium were assigned rooms to avoid sharing rooms as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>The Niirada Classroom of Oku High School was established in 1955, and only people with leprosy were allowed
            to study there. It is a regular daytime high school with a capacity of 30 students per grade. I entered the
            school as a seventh-term student, and at that time there were 80 boys and 35 girls. </p>
        <p>Although it was a general course, students were required to choose one elective subject from the three
            subjects of commerce, agriculture, and home economics, perhaps in preparation for returning to society after
            graduation. </p>
        <p>The class schedule was 50 minutes long, with three periods of classes in the morning, and the morning session
            ended at 12:20 pm. </p>
        <p>Lunch was taken in the dorm cafeteria, and classes generally ended at the fourth period in the afternoon. The
            number of class hours per week was set at 25, which was a relatively generous schedule, and each student
            participated in club activities after school. </p>
        <p>The late starting time of 9:20 a.m. was due to a special circumstance in which students had to take medical
            treatment.</p>

        <p>My first routine physical examination took place. </p>
        <p>As seat number two, I was already naked and waiting in the next room. Arai came out of the examination room
            shortly afterwards with a medical checkup form in his hand. </p>
        <p>“Please come in, Mr. Iha.” </p>
        <p>This was my first encounter with Dr. Chozo Hashizume. </p>
        <p>In 1993, I had a chance to have a drink with Dr. Naoichi Tsuyama (former professor of orthopedics at the
            University of Tokyo and former president of the National Rehabilitation Center for the Disabled). As we
            shared a drink, Dr. Tsuyama, who had spotted the surgical scar on my hand, asked me a question. </p>
        <p>“Mr. Iha, who performed that surgery?” </p>
        <p>“A doctor named Chozo Hashizume who worked at a leprosy sanatorium in Okayama,” I said. </p>
        <p>"Wow, Hashizume. Is that right? He's a first-rate physician," he said. I was surprised that he knew Dr.
            Hashizume. </p>
        <p>My encounter with the young, renowned doctor, whose name now rings out in the orthopedic surgery community,
            would change my life 180 degrees.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>Two young surgeons had been assigned to Nagashima Aiseien since this spring. </p>
        <p>Patients who have been in the hospital for a long time are beginning to evaluate doctors as usual. </p>
        <p>“Dr. Yutaka Yabe's skills are top-notch. Dr. Hashizume is mediocre.” </p>
        <p>I asked them on what basis they made this assessment. </p>
        <p>“Dr. Yabe is from Keio University School of Medicine, and Dr. Hashizume is from Shinshu University School of
            Medicine…” The patients' </p>
        <p>"worldly consciousness" that ranked them by the university they graduated from, even on this remote island,
            was strange. In addition, the following whisper reached my ears. </p>
        <p>“Dr. Hashizume recommends surgery right away, so patients are running away from him.” </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>He, as was his custom, placed his stethoscope on my chest and back, and completed a brief medical interview.
            Then he asked, </p>
        <p>"Mr. Iha, your hands and left leg are drooping. Could you take off your socks and let me take a look?" </p>
        <p>He checked the functions of my hands and feet for a while. </p>
        <p>“It would be inconvenient as it is. Especially, your feet have begun to deform, and you will suffer from
            Plantar perforation disease.” </p>
        <p>The troubles had already begun. My left foot had been tormenting me since the fall. After a short trip or
            strenuous exercise, a blood blister (hematoma) would soon appear on the bottom of my left foot, and it would
            take a long time to heal. He said, </p>
        <p>"With plastic surgery, the function of your limbs will be restored." </p>
        <p>His reputation was true. He was recommending surgery right away, even for me, I thought as I listened. </p>
        <p>“Could I have a piece of paper to write something down?” he asked the nurse. </p>
        <p>When he received the paper, he suddenly stood in front of me and began to explain the surgical procedure with
            illustrations. The explanation continued for a long time. </p>
        <p>Mrs. Tanaka, who was present as a nurse, finally grows numb and urges him on. </p>
        <p>She said, "Dr. Hashizume, we still have a lot of students waiting for you..." </p>
        <p>“Oh, I see. I understand. What room is your dormitory, Mr. Iha?” he asked. “Yes, room 18.” </p>
        <p>“I'll be there tonight.” </p>
        <p>Dr. Hashizume called out to me as I was leaving the examination room. </p>
        <p>“I'm sure you will be able to run after the surgery, Mr. Iha. You may even be able to play catch-ball.” </p>
        <p>Run! Play catch! </p>
        <p>These words, which had already left me, were strangely familiar to my ears. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>That evening, I was in my room prepping for my Chinese literature class. This is because Arai had been
            guessed in yesterday's class, and I had expected that I would surely be guessed tomorrow, given the seating
            order.</p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>

    The nation is broken, though mountains and rivers remain. 
    In cities in the Spring, the grass and trees grow deeply. 
    Sensing the moment, flowers shed tears. 
    The beacons have burnt continuously for three months. 
    A letter from home is worth ten-thousand pieces of gold. 
    My white hair is even scarcer from scratching. 
    And can barely hold a hairpin.

            </pre>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>"Good evening. Is this Mr. Iha's room?" </p>
        <p>Dr. Hashizume's voice was heard in the dormitory, which is rarely visited by outsiders other than teachers.
            "May I come in now?" He suddenly came to my room. </p>
        <p>The distance between the doctor's office and the high school dormitory was about a two-kilometer walk over
            two hills. I had expected him to visit me, but I had not expected that he actually would come to visit me
            this evening. </p>
        <p>The doctor opens the paper he had written on in front of me this morning again. New writing had been added
            there in red ink. </p>
        <p>"I didn't have time this morning."</p>
        <p>Once again, he began to talk, starting with the surgical method and ending with the possibility of functional
            recovery. I tried to be polite, but I was not in the mood. His explanation continued for nearly two hours,
            until just before curfew. </p>
        <p>The doctor's nighttime visits continued for a month. </p>
        <p>His enthusiasm was so extraordinary that my classmates called him "Iha's night lover."</p>
        <p>His talk covered many areas, and he repeated detailed explanations to me, whose medical knowledge was
            limited. </p>
        <p>Sometimes he even brought in medical books and talked about "muscle structure," "the chain of command between
            the brain and nerves," and even "bone function." It was enough to make me wonder if this is how lectures are
            given in medical schools. </p>
        <p>His repeated visits to me led me to ask him some rather rude questions. </p>
        <p>"Doctor, you recommend me so enthusiastically, do you have any surgical cases here?" </p>
        <p>"I have had two operations on my patient's legs." </p>
        <p>"Were they successful?" </p>
        <p>"I'm sure it will be fine, but the stitches haven't been removed yet, and post-operative results will become
            clearer in the rehab afterward." </p>
        <p>I thought that was a very honest answer. </p>
        <p>"What about hands?" </p>
        <p>"No, we have not yet had a case like yours where there is such a high degree of dysfunction in the
            dorsiflexion of the wrist joint or in the extension of the fingers. If you agree, this would be the first
            case."</p>
        <p>Even on this day, he was not able to subdue my consent. </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, his visits continued. As we became accustomed to each other, he began to talk about everything
            from his student days to his way of life as a human being.</p>
        <p>In our chat, he casually mentioned something that struck me. </p>
        <p>"The times are changing. Leprosy will become a common disease. The deformity of the limbs will be merely an
            aftereffect of the disease. Mr. Iha, you must improve the function of your limbs in preparation for your
            return to society." </p>
        <p>"What? Return to society! Me?" </p>
        <p>These were completely unexpected words. </p>
        <p>I had already found a conclusion about my life. </p>
        <p>While my classmates were always talking about their post-graduation dreams, I had avoided joining their
            circle of friends. I had always calmly accepted that the dream of "returning to society" was out of my
            league.</p>
        <p>I was even able to come to high school and learn. I am happy. From now on, I will make the sanatorium my home
            for the rest of my life with people who are suffering from the same disease, "without greed or resentment. I
            am sure that I will be able to find "my life" in this place.</p>
        <p>I had been reminded of this during these 2 months of high school life. My aftereffects in my limbs were the
            most severe of all the students in the school, and even group life at the high school was not easy, and I
            had to push myself very hard to keep up with everyone. </p>
        <p>"Doctor, who are you talking about?" </p>
        <p>"You, of course." </p>
        <p>"You're kidding." </p>
        <p>"What? Why?" </p>
        <p>"Sir! Do you think it's possible for me to return to society?" </p>
        <p>"Of course, you can. It depends on how you feel. Even so, a minimum level of bodily function is necessary to
            return to society and live." </p>
        <p>My attitude, which had always been one of refusal, changed very easily with this conversation. </p>
        <p>"I will do it! Please do it to me. I'll leave everything to you!"</p>

    <h2 id="cyborg">Cyborg</h2>
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>My first surgery was performed in December 1963. </p>
        <p>For the next five years, my days were spent undergoing plastic surgery and rehabilitation. I had as many as
            12 surgeries, so many that Dr. Hashizume said, "The record for the number of scalpels and sutures performed
            on a single person will probably never be broken."</p>
        <p>Ten of these surgeries were concentrated in the latter three years, which means that I had one surgery every
            four months. </p>
        <p>Even including the time spent in rehabilitation, I cannot help but think to myself, how could I have been cut
            up so frequently? </p>
        <p>Sometimes I look at my surgical stitches and think to myself that I look like a cyborg.</p>
        <p>For about three days after the surgery, my body temperature always rose to nearly 40 degrees Celsius. I had a
            desk in my hospital room arranged specially, and since I was going into surgery to balance schoolwork, I
            waited for that fever to subside and went to school from my hospital room. My classmates used to tease and
            call me “Iha, who looked good in a white cast and crutches.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>It was almost time for the first leg surgery. I was given an orange pill. </p>
        <p>"It was thirty minutes before the surgery. Mr. Iha, this medicine is a tranquilizer. Please go to the
            bathroom before the surgery." </p>
        <p>Strangely, I felt calm. The day before, I had been told that the surgery would take about two hours, so I was
            counting the hours after the surgery, thinking that I would be home before noon.</p>
        <p>Inside the operating room, a doctor and four nurses were already waiting for me, dressed in light green
            surgical gowns. </p>
        <p>I was surprised when I was placed on the operating table. The walls of the operating room were covered with
            illustrations of what appeared to be the order of operations. </p>
        <p>As the lumbar anesthesia was administered, I felt a gradual warming and swelling from my waist to my toes.
            The tourniquet on the left thigh was closed with great force. A blood pressure cuff was attached to my
            outstretched and immobilized arm. </p>
        <p>"Blood pressure, 120 above, 80 below, pulse 85, all normal." Dr. Hashizume silently disinfects my leg that
            the nurse is lifting. "Surgery will begin at 9:18."</p>
        <p>The nurse standing to my left covered her body as she leaned over my face. The nurse's breast felt soft and
            warm against my face through the surgical gown. For a moment, the bulge distracted me. It was at that
            moment. </p>
        <p>I felt a sharp pain in my right leg, as if a burning tong had been inserted into it. </p>
        <p>I heard a sound and something was pulled out. It was so fast that I didn't even have time to scream “Ouch!”
        </p>
        <p>"Mr. Iha, I pulled out the tendon of your right leg. I will connect this tendon to your left leg. It's
            beautiful, do you want to see?" </p>
        <p>Dr. Hashizume showed me the tendon that had just been removed, soaked in saline solution. The tendon was pale
            yellow, like kanpyo (strips of dried gourd)."</p>
        <p>“Then let's begin. Iha-san, how would you like to watch your own surgery? It takes a little courage,” </p>
        <p>I felt that Dr. Hashizume was testing me.</p>
        <p>“Yes, please show me.”</p>
        <p>Even now, as I recall, something completely unorthodox was beginning to happen. I could only consider myself
            extremely lucky to be able to observe the surgical procedure being carried out on me. Dr. Hashizume asked a
            nurse, </p>
        <p>“Please remove his face covering and raise the pillow a little.”</p>
        <p>On the tray next to the operating table, scalpels and tweezers could be seen gleaming. </p>
        <p>As the scalpel was inserted vertically into my leg, the dermis, fat, and muscle were separated, as if a
            curtain was being opened. </p>
        <p>Blood was oozing from the capillaries, and the nurse quickly wiped it away with gauze, revealing the blood
            vessels underneath and the white bone surrounded by thin fat.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hashizume's voice rang out between surgeries. </p>
        <p>“5. Okay.” “10. Done."</p>
        <p>The pictures on the wall must have been the order of surgery. </p>
        <p>The clock in the operating theater showed that it was past 10:30.</p>
        <p>“Raise his toe as high as you can," the doctor gave instructions to the nurse. </p>
        <p>The tendon in my right leg was connected to my left leg. Then four-centimeter-long screws were driven in on
            each side of my ankle.</p>
        <p>Just a few moments earlier, the tourniquet had been cutting into my thigh, and I was experiencing tearing
            pains in my lower back. I had been counting the ceiling tiles from right to left, bottom to top, in order to
            distract myself from this immense pain.</p>
        <p>“One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...”</p>
        <p>“Blood pressure, top 150. Lower 100. Pulse 102."</p>
        <p>“The anesthesia is wearing off. Iha-san, can you hold out a little longer?”</p>
        <p>Can you endure it? When asked, it is difficult to say, "No, I can't do it anymore."</p>
        <p>“Yes, I'm fine. I can endure...,” I answered.</p>
        <p>The ticking of the seconds is heard high and slow. The pain of the tourniquet on my thigh was unintentionally
            causing my face to sway to the left and to the right.</p>
        <p>“Iha-san, I'm stitching you up now, so it's almost over.”</p>
        <p>Thirty minutes had passed since I was told it was almost time.</p>
        <p>“Okay, Iha-san, we're done.” Dr. Hashizume's loud voice reached my ears. I exhaled loudly and looked up at
            the clock on the wall. It was 11:22 am.</p>
        <p></p>

        <p>Suddenly, I was shaken in bed. </p>
        <p>The clock on my bedside table said it was still past 5 am.</p>
        <p>“Iha-san, I've come up with a good idea. This is good, this will definitely work. Yesterday, I also received
            advice from Assistant Professor Tsushita and Lecturer Tani at Okayama University. It was difficult for me to
            reach a point of conviction, but I am sure this will work.”</p>
        <p>Dr. Hashizume was standing beside the bed, still in plain clothes, with an excited red face.</p>
        <p>“I had a sudden flash of inspiration in the toilet, ... and ran out of the government building without a
            moment's thought. ...”</p>
        <p>He had a notebook in his hand, in which he had probably written many times before, and he spread it out in
            front of me and suddenly began to explain the surgical procedure.</p>
        <p>Soon after, the operation on my left hand started.</p>
        <p>This surgery was published in March 1976 in the academic paper "Orthopedic treatment of functional disorders
            of the limbs of leprosy patients." He was awarded the twenty-first "Sakurane Prize (Japanese Leprosy Society
            Prize)" at the 53rd General Meeting of the Leprosy Society in 1980 in recognition of his achievements as an
            orthopedic surgeon.</p>
        <p>“The left-hand surgery alone requires at least three times.” The interval between surgeries is about two
            months, and the procedure focuses on tendon transfer. This is a functional conversion, which means that the
            functions in your body that used to move under the command of your brain will be changed to another
            function. Because the voluntary nerve commands themselves are being converted, the body image that has been
            retained has to be destroyed. That is why the post-operative rehabilitation will be so difficult. The way
            you and I work together will be the key to success.”</p>
        <p>The first operation took place.</p>
        <p>The rotator caris muscle<sup id="*1"><a href="#1">*1</a></sup> was detached from the radius<sup id="*2"><a
                    href="#2">*2</a></sup>, and the radial carpal flexor muscle was detached medial to the wrist joint.
            The radial carpal flexor muscle was brought out through the radial and ulna<sup id="*3"><a href="#3">*3</a></sup> to
            the dorsal aspect of the hand and divided in two, with the rotator cirrus muscle connected to the extensor
            carpi radialis short and extensor carpi radialis long. One of the divided radial carpal flexors was
            connected to the extensor digitorum longus<sup id="*4"><a href="#4">*4</a></sup>, one to the extensor digitorum
            totalis muscle<sup id="*5"><a href="#5">*5</a></sup>, the intrinsic instruction extensor muscle<sup id="*6"><a
                    href="#6">*6</a></sup>, and extensor muscle of the little finger, and the operation was completed by
            tearing part of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and suturing it to the extensor digitorum longus tendon
            to provide better support for the mother finger (thumb).</p>
        <p>Three weeks later, the cast was cut, and the stitches removed.</p>
        <p>“The suture wound is clean. Tomorrow I'll finally start rehabilitation for functional conversion. It's a
            tough time ahead.”</p>
        <p>As Dr. Hashizume said, the two of us in the rehabilitation room had been struggling for four hours, but my
            wrist remained stiff and it could not be deflected outwards.</p>
        <p>“Twist it inwards by about 15 degrees. Order your brain to do so!”</p>
        <p>The doctor's voice echoed around the room. I tried again and again, but my wrist would not budge at all.</p>
        <p>"See? Throw out all your preconceptions. Twist it inwards. Picture it in your head, inside out." </p>
        <p>Sweat was pouring out of both our faces. It had been four hours since 10 am. </p>
        <p>“It's no good, Iha-san. Shall we take a short break and have lunch at ------?” </p>
        <p>“I'm fine, doctor. Let's continue.” </p>
        <p>“Okay, then, I'll put my hand on you, and you can stare at it there. Twist inwards. Yes, yes, I can feel a
            little bit of movement.” </p>
        <p>The clock was pointing just before 4 pm. </p>
        <p>…! </p>
        <p>…It moved! </p>
        <p>My wrist moved faintly upwards. </p>
        <p>“Yes, yes. It's moving, Iha-san. It's moving. We've got it, yes.” </p>
        <p>“Doctor, I understand. I got it!"</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>The second operation took place two months later. </p>
        <p>The superficial flexor of the third finger was detached at the base of the finger, drawn out to the central
            region of the palm, divided into four equal parts, and the connections are made to the four fingers, index,
            middle, ring, and little fingers.</p>
        <p>The third operation would be completed with a maternal finger opposition reconstruction utilizing the fourth
            flexor digitorum superficialis muscle<sup id="*7"><a href="#7">*7</a></sup>. This surgical process was performed in
            the same way on the right hand. </p>
        <p>Four weeks had passed since the operation. </p>
        <p>“Iha-san, try throwing this tennis ball as hard as you can.” </p>
        <p>I held the ball. Then I threw it. </p>
        <p>“Finally, I can….” </p>
        <p>The ball, which I threw with all my might, rolled 30 meters away.</p>

        <p>Since I left Okinawa for the mainland to go to high school, there has been a problem that I have not been
            able to escape from my attention. It is "Okinawa” for me. The idea of 'Okinawa' that I should have escaped
            from was growing bigger and bigger in my mind as the days went by.</p>
        <p>In March 1963, I opened a newspaper that had arrived from Okinawa. The first thing I saw on the front page
            was a report on the "myth of self-government" by the High Commissioner for Okinawa, Mr. Paul Wyatt Craway.
        </p>
        <p>“At the present time, autonomy is a myth and does not exist. Unless the inhabitants of Ryukyu (Okinawa)
            decide once again of their own free will to create an independent nation-state, there will be no autonomy in
            the future," he declared. </p>
        <p>It was as if to say, 'This island was taken from the Japanese army with the precious blood of the US
            military. The people of Okinawa, who are third-class citizens, cannot possibly have the capacity for
            self-government. It is an illusion that you have an ability to decide the direction of Okinawa by
            yourselves. The High Commissioner is the highest authority in Okinawa, and his authority is absolute. That
            is why I also appointed the head of the Ryukyuan executive branch. Okinawans, there is no such thing as a
            return to Japan. When the Ryukyu Islands become independent, we will give you autonomy.’</p>
        <p>It was tantamount to threatening the residents of Okinawa. </p>
        <p>"My Okinawa" was being humiliated. Anger, which had no place to go, ran through my body. </p>
        <p>I threw down the newspaper and lay down on the tatami mat. The fall sunlight shone directly into the
            curtainless room.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>When I close my eyes, I remember the summer of 1955 and the image of the Majiya farmers of Iejima, who had
            lost their land to the US military and were now living as beggars.</p>
        <p>The farmers were clustered under the eaves of Ishikawa Market, playing the sanshin (Okinawan three-stringed
            instrument) and singing.</p>
        <p>The farmers were singing and playing the sanshin (Okinawan three-stringed guitar).</p>
        <p>“The US took our land, houses, and fields, and we 152 residents were forced to leave the village. We had to
            become beggars.”</p>
        <p>Many people surrounded them, all shedding tears. One after another, they put money into the empty can placed
            in front of the musilo (Woven mat esp. one made of straw).</p>
        <p>Behind was a banner that read: 'It is shameful to beg, but it is even more shameful to make people beg'.</p>
        <p>As a twelve-year-old boy, I was also in the circle, shedding tears. But there was no money I could give them.
        </p>
        <p>I turned around and saw the Americans on the Ishigawa Beach, which is separated from the road by a wire
            fence, and Americans in tops and swimming costumes enjoying their weekend on the wide grassy lawn. The
            images overlap as if in stop motion.</p>
        <p>The sound of red-lipped women and American soldiers at a party held every Saturday at Miss Ishikawa's
            restaurant near my parents' house also came to my ears.</p>
        <p>An American soldier was holding a woman under his arm. They leaned over the parapet of the second floor and
            threw chewing gum and even condoms down into the circle of children below.</p>
        <p>“Please give me. Please."</p>
        <p>American soldiers clapped their hands and shouted. Inflated contraceptive balloons swayed in the children's
            hands. I joined them, picking up the gum that was being thrown down.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, I was slapped. There was my father standing with a furious look on his face.</p>
        <p>"Uchinanchu (Okinawans) are not beggars!” </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>“Why is that? Why is it always only in Okinawa? Even now ----:" </p>
        <p>Mr. Ishigaki, who helped me a lot in Kagoshima, introduced me to a man whom he hoped I would meet when I went
            to high school. He was Mr. Osamu Chiba. </p>
        <p>“He is a man who has a lot to learn as a human being. Your sensibilities are too keen, so you can learn from
            him the serenity of life. In 1937, at the age of 27, Mr. Chiba got leprosy in Okinawa and gave up teaching.
            He is now recuperating at Nagashima Aiseien. I think he is an excellent teacher, both as a Christian and as
            a literary figure for you." </p>
        <p>I used to visit Mr. Chiba at his home whenever I could find the time. He was quiet and limpid and listened to
            me, even when I was a young man who asked him vehemently about things, without ever imposing his own
            opinions on me. </p>
        <p>However, the intensity with which he recited poems about his hometown Okinawa was something I would never
            have expected from his everyday serenity.</p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <pre>
    Since the day my family register was burnt 
    in the Battle of Okinawa, 
    I have been gone. I live like this.

    My friends and I have become fools on the inside 
    and want to return to the mainland. 
    We all keep our voices down.
    
    Feeling the dark oppressive forces, 
    I read back the articles downtrodden Okinawa.
    
    Widow's resentment at having her land 
    leased for 18 sen (one-hundredth of a yen) 
    per tsubo (3.31 square meters). 
    Is she not my sister?
    
    Okinawa, where voices still spit blood. 
    It feels as if I was in the middle of a war.

            (Osamu Chiba "Songbook Coral Reef")
            </pre>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>After a while, my words to Mr. Chiba became harsh, for the "Okinawa" in me began to deny even the prayers of
            the Christians. </p>
        <p>“Mr. Chiba, is it possible for Okinawa to come back just by putting anger into words? Can tanka poetry change
            the mistakes of Yamato (mainland)? Can Christ's prayer save Okinawa today?" </p>
        <p>Mr. Chiba only shed tears and made no retort to my vehement questions. His wife, who was listening to our
            conversation next to me, also wept. </p>
        <p>A short time later, I stayed away from Mr. Chiba. </p>
        <p>My Okinawa had gradually come to believe in the "political power". Even at school, I began to change. I
            couldn't stand the way the classes were taught, in which 'peace', 'freedom', and 'democracy' were abstractly
            mentioned without living words. </p>
        <p>--In the lecture ---The US deployment in the Vietnam War was at the request of the South Vietnamese
            government. -- if Vietnam became a communist state, the Asian democracies would be under a lot of threat-. I
            was particularly vehement in such opposition to the domino theory. </p>
        <p>“At the very least, American 'democracy' and 'freedom' with Okinawa as a staging post is a lie. The choice of
            a country's political system should be made by its people." </p>
        <p>I also objected to explanations that lump 'nationalism' together with 'ethnic group' alone. </p>
        <p>It is wrong to think in general terms of the ethnic group and religion, I said. “Depending on the class you
            belong to within that ethnic group, nationalism can mean very different things.” </p>
        <p>The classroom had turned into a place of discussion between the teacher and me. </p>
        <p>“Iha-kun, in high school, when you have little social experience, it is too early to be so biased.” </p>
        <p>My homeroom teacher began to warn me. There was no doubt that I had been an unmanageable student for the
            teacher for quite some time. However, I did not agree with the 'biased' instruction either. </p>
        <p>“Teaching the world and society in balance is not education. We should speak with facts. It is a lie that the
            US is trying to do justice to the whole world. I saw it in Okinawa!" </p>
        <p>This recurring argument between teacher and student later became a topic of discussion at the reunion. </p>
        <p>“We never had such a good time in class," they said.</p>

    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>The change in my consciousness was also evident in the daily routine of my high school life. My reading
            tended to focus on books on Russian literature and politics, and I gradually found myself at the heart of
            student council activities. </p>
        <p>Since its foundation, the Niirada classroom had not been allowed to have 'school trips'. </p>
        <p>At best, class trips were limited to day trips by bus or by boat to Oshima Seishoen, a sanatorium for
            Hansen's Disease in Kagawa Prefecture, as a typical class trip. </p>
        <p>The Leprosy Prevention Law stood in the way. The only way for patients to leave the sanatorium was with a
            doctor's diagnosis and 'permission to go out' or 'permission for temporary return home'. </p>
        <p>Since the school's foundation, the issue of school excursions has been a long-held wish of all students but
            has been rejected year after year. Three reasons were given for this. </p>
        <p>The first problem is that we always need to have 'medical clearance' issued for each of us before we can go
            out. Even within a class, there are 'permit holders' and 'non-permit holders' depending on each person's
            medical condition, and the class is not allowed to go out. </p>
        <p>One solution is the special group transport system used at the time of enrollment and graduation, but this is
            also impossible due to cost issues. </p>
        <p>Next was the problem of accommodation. </p>
        <p>As a solution, a proposal was made to use sanatoriums across the country as key stations, but the problem of
            transport to these locations was an impasse again. </p>
        <p>The final issue was the problem of cost burdens. Without a solution to the first two issues, the question of
            costs was naturally not even a subject of discussion. </p>
        <p>We did not see the 'school trip problem' at Niirada as just a group trip. We saw it as a 'challenge to social
            discrimination and prejudice'. </p>
        <p>It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. </p>
        <p>In 1963, after the return train for graduates, the transport system we called 'special call-up trains' was
            abolished, and from the following year onwards, we could travel in the same cabins as ordinary passengers.
        </p>
        <p>We didn't want to miss the opportunity. </p>
        <p>In June 1964, the student council organized a 'School Trip Acquisition Committee' and elected eight members.
            This committee was set in motion. </p>
        <p>Collective negotiations with the director, in which all students participated, and meetings between the
            teachers and the committee were held to discuss the problems. The issues were gradually narrowed down after
            numerous rounds of negotiations. The following four points were agreed upon.</p>
        <p>(1) The students on the school excursion must test negative for germs. </p>
        <p>(2) Permission must be obtained from the Okayama Prefectural Board of Education. </p>
        <p>(3) The students must pay for the trip themselves. </p>
        <p>(4) Find a place to stay.</p>
        <p>However, the committee decided that simply waiting for time to pass wouldn't lead to a successful
            breakthrough. They came up with the following methods:</p>
        <p>(1) Each person applies separately for a "temporary return home" during the winter break. </p>
        <p>(2) Negotiate with the neighborhood council to raise funds for expenses, and have the high school students
            undertake after-school work in the school to accumulate wages. </p>
        <p>(3) Accommodation will be arranged in cooperation of Kansai FIWC (Friends International Work Camp). </p>
        <p>(4) Permission from the Okayama Prefectural Board of Education is based on the premise that the school trip
            will be conducted in groups. Since this outing is being undertaken individually, it doesn't fall under this
            condition and does not need to be reported.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>First, the 7th graders, the most senior students, were sent out separately on the same day to meet up at
            their destination. </p>
        <p>Finally, starting from January 3rd, 1965, we were able to send them to Osaka, Nara, and Kyoto for five days
            and four nights under the name of "group homecoming". </p>
        <p>Although I was at the center of the plan to develop this policy, I was not a participating member. I was on
            the operating table for my sixth plastic surgery at the time. </p>
        <p>It would be another 10 years before Niirada School would be able to organize an 'Authorized school trip'.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>In 1995, a north wind was howling outside my window. </p>
        <p>“Hello, Iha-san. I'm Setsuko from the eighth grade. I finally got your phone number after calling Keiko. Yes,
            I haven't seen you for 30 years. Did you watch TV? I don't think Iha-san watches singing programs on TV. I
            was just watching a TV program about nostalgic hit songs earlier. Kazuo Funaki was singing a song called
            'High School Senior'. When I hear this song, I always remember your face, so I suddenly wanted to talk to
            you. I couldn't stop crying when I heard this song because I knew you couldn't participate in the school
            trip, and you didn't even say a word about it to everyone. ----: I'll never forget how you took the lead in
            scolding and encouraging us to pursue our dreams come true. I will never forget that.”</p>

        <p>My ex-wife, Akiko, was present in the operating theater as a surgical nurse during my major plastic surgery
            operations. In a sense, she witnessed the entire process of 'human transformation', both during the
            operation and in post-operative rehabilitation. After graduating from the assistant nursing school, she was
            assigned to the surgical ward. She was assigned to pre- and post-operative patients and acted as a liaison
            between the patients and Dr. Hashizume. </p>
        <p>While on the stretcher on the way to my fourth operation, Akiko asked me, "Why do you keep having surgeries
            as if you are obsessed with something?" </p>
        <p>“---. 'This is the only way for a human being to return to normalcy." </p>
        <p>"Normalcy?" She laughed at me, finding the expression amusing. </p>
        <p>“I have a question for you as well. ----: I believe you are from Kagoshima Prefecture, aren't you? Why did
            you come all the way to Okayama for nursing school? There are nursing schools in Kagoshima too, so why did
            you choose the nursing school at the leprosy sanatorium?" </p>
        <p>There was a pause before she replied. </p>
        <p>“In Kagoshima, because my family is poor. Here I don't have to pay for school fees. My homeroom teacher
            recommended it to me.” </p>
        <p>Akiko's voice was quiet as she answered with her eyes downcast. </p>
        <p>I felt like I had heard something I shouldn't have. </p>
        <p>“I'm sorry. I asked you something you didn't want to answer." </p>
        <p>“It's all right. It's the truth.”</p>
        <p>This was the beginning of a very natural exchange of conversation between the two of us. Shortly afterwards,
            Akiko told me that she was currently taking a correspondence course in high school to prepare for the
            entrance examination to a higher nursing school two years later. </p>
        <p>“Which nursing school are you applying to?" </p>
        <p>“Tokyo.” </p>
        <p>Coincidentally, I had also decided to go to Tokyo to study, and we had a lively conversation, dreaming of our
            reunion in Tokyo. Later, Akiko would bring answer sheets from her correspondence course to my hospital room.
        </p>
        <p>Surgeries were repeated, and my limb functions gradually recovered. Strangely enough, the 'better' that had
            been the basis for all my choices began to waver. The state of my psyche was rising. </p>
        <p>I was beginning to regain a certain confidence in the society I was about to enter, although it was still
            vague. I was also twenty-three years old.</p>
        <p>Above all, the most significant change was in my attitude towards the opposite sex. I had disciplined myself
            not to have a relationship with a woman for the rest of my life, but in front of Akiko, I had crumbled. </p>
        <p>However, a rejection, born of a great error, awaited me. </p>
        <p>All the planned operations were completed. It was in November, with just two months left before I was to
            leave for Tokyo. </p>
        <p>I asked, "Akiko-san, when you leave for Tokyo, will you go out with me?" </p>
        <p>Akiko looked a little mystified for a moment. </p>
        <p>“What do you mean by 'going out with me'?” </p>
        <p>“I like you, Akiko-san." </p>
        <p>The first time I saw her, the look on Akiko's face changed immediately. </p>
        <p>“I'm three years younger than you, Iha-san, but I work to support myself. How about you? You are still in the
            sanatorium and have yet to take responsibility for your own life. How can there be equal human relations
            between men and women under those circumstances? First of all, you have the wrong approach!" </p>
        <p>I couldn't say a word. I wasn't able to understand what she was saying, but I could see that she was right.
        </p>
        <p>"All right. I will watch and wait!" </p>
        <p>My heart was filled with determination.</p>

        <p>In April 1967, it was decided that I would enroll in the Central Labor Academy (now Musashino Foreign
            Language College). </p>
        <p>The academy was opened in 1951 with the founding spirit of "taking learning out of the ivory tower and into
            society and life ". The professors who agreed with this statement included Marxist economists and
            theoretical leaders of the left-wing movement of the time, and they taught courses that went beyond the
            framework of the university. </p>
        <p>The institute was positioned as a vocational school, offering a main course (politics and economics) and a
            literature course. I studied in the main course for two years. </p>
        <p>Dr. Minoru Narita (currently Chairman of the Management Committee of Prince Takamatsu Memorial Hansen's
            Disease Museum and Honorary Director of National Sanatorium Tama Zenshoen in Tokyo) took my situation into
            consideration and decided to perform an extension operation on the thumb of my left foot at the same
            sanatorium. As a result, I was transferred there. </p>
        <p>At first glance, I was told that I needed treatment, but in truth, Dr. Narita advised me that if I attended
            school from Zenshoen, I would not have to worry about housing or living there. I decided to make the most of
            his goodwill. My treatment for leprosy had already been considered unnecessary six years earlier, and no
            medication had been administered.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>February 2, 1967. I was at the ticket office in Okayama Station to buy a ticket for the Sanyo Main Line from
            Okayama to Osaka and a reserved Shinkansen train ticket from Osaka to Tokyo. </p>
        <p>My heart was racing.</p>
        <p>At last, I would be able to sit in the same seat as ordinary passengers. </p>
        <p>Moreover, I would be able to take the Shinkansen train I had dreamt of. </p>
        <p>The ticket is now in my hand. </p>
        <p>All the scenery around me seemed to be smiling at me. </p>
        <p>At the Tenmaya restaurant in front of Okayama Station, I excitedly ordered my first omelet. I felt as if even
            the ten fingers of my hands, which had undergone surgery, had recovered to a state of perfection. </p>
        <p>I was so happy. Is this how it feels? </p>
        <p>The Chinese character ‘kiyu,’ representing 'groundless fear,' floated around in my head in the form of an
            incredibly large character.</p>
        <p>At the bus terminal in front of Tenmaya, I checked the departure time for Mushiake, and to my good fortune,
            there was a 14:15 departure to Ushimado. I didn't have to wait long. </p>
        <p>It's just in time to catch the 4:10 pm scheduled connecting ferryboat, so everything is going well today. I'm
            lucky!</p>
        <p>“Mushiake, one adult,” </p>
        <p>I said at the ticket office with a beaming voice. </p>
        <p>When I boarded the Ryobi bus, there were only seven or eight passengers on board, probably due to the time. I
            sat in the rearmost seat. Then, I suddenly felt uneasy as the thought crossed my mind that I had bought a
            ticket at Okayama Station for the first time and had not checked the departure date and time. I hurriedly
            took the ticket out of my pocket.</p>
        <p>Departure from Okayama on February 7, 10:10 am. Departure from Osaka at ---. No doubt about it, everything's
            fine! </p>
        <p>As I tucked the ticket back into my pocket, I felt as if I had purchased an incredibly valuable treasure.</p>
        <p>“Soon we will arrive at Saidai-ji Temple, Saidai-ji Temple,” the conductor announced. </p>
        <p>“The driver and conductor will change at Saidaiji. I am very sorry, but this bus will be waiting at Saidaiji
            for 10 minutes,” he continued.</p>
        <p>At Saidaiji, the relay point, three new passengers boarded the bus. The young conductor, with his hat at an
            angle, closed the bus door as he signaled the bus to leave. </p>
        <p>A few moments later, the roof tiles of a pagoda came into view through the bus windows, breaking the sky
            across the river. The temple was Saidai-ji Temple, where the Naked Festival is held.</p>
        <p>Although I had been in Okayama for six years, I had never seen the Naked Festival. Next time I come to
            Okayama, I will plan to visit during the festival, I thought.</p>
        <p>After passing Oku, there were only two passengers on the bus. Without any new passengers, the bus passed one
            stop after another without stopping. Eventually, a fifty-year-old lady also got off the bus at Ushimado.
        </p>
        <p>I was the only passenger on the bus. The conductor kept looking back and glancing at me. </p>
        <p>The bus entered a row of low houses, and soon the sea came into view ahead.</p>
        <p>“Next stop, Mushiake,” the conductor announced in a brusque manner. </p>
        <p>When I got off the bus after nearly two hours, I could smell the scent of the tide. The wind from across the
            Seto Inland Sea tugged at the hems of my trousers.</p>
        <p>The conductor got off the bus and looked at my hand with his gaze downcast. I bailed and held out the ticket
            to the conductor.</p>
        <p>Oh no!</p>
        <p>Somehow the ticket had fallen between us.</p>
        <p>I thought it was my fault for giving him the ticket. I bent down and picked up the ticket in a hurry.</p>
        <p>“I'm sorry,” I said as I handed the ticket to the conductor again. However, the conductor suddenly withdrew
            his hand, and the ticket fell again onto the cracked concrete.</p>
        <p>The conductor then unexpectedly took an action.</p>
        <p>He kicked the ticket off the quay into the sea.</p>
        <p>Ah…!!</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>Only the sound of the engine in the liaison ship reached my ears. An unexplainable fear had been gripping me
            since then…. </p>
        <p>-------From now on, I'm going to face this every day! </p>
        <p>I can't stop my body from shaking. </p>
        <p>-------I knew I couldn't do it. If only I had been content with my life on the island. </p>
        <p>I tried to elevate my own status by undergoing plastic surgery. </p>
        <p>That's why… I kept going around and around in my head. That night, at last, at least, I couldn't sleep at
            all.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>I returned from Okayama Station, and suddenly my mind had closed. I wondered if Dr. Hashizume hearing my
            distress; at eight o'clock, before the clinic started, he came to visit me. </p>
        <p>“Good morning, how are you? Are you ready for Tokyo?” </p>
        <p>-------If only this doctor had not appeared before me – </p>
        <p>For some reason, I suddenly thought that way. </p>
        <p>“I think I'll stop going there.” </p>
        <p>“Suddenly…, that's not like you.” </p>
        <p>“I still can't do it.” </p>
        <p>“You can't do it anymore? What happened?” </p>
        <p>I didn't want to talk about it when asked. I felt like I was exposing my shame. </p>
        <p>“Well, it's your own thing. It's up to you to decide.” </p>
        <p>When he said it in such a dismissive way, I felt that I wanted only the teacher to hear about the unjust and
            unforgivable treatment I experienced. </p>
        <p>“I see what happened to you, and that's why you're canceling your trip to Tokyo.” </p>
        <p>“I've already lost my confidence.” </p>
        <p>“I see. So, you approve of the conductor's conduct?” </p>
        <p>“No! I cannot allow it!” </p>
        <p>“Because you admit to that unreasonable behavior. You turned tail and ran away even though it happened only
            once." </p>
        <p>It was a completely unexpected turn of events. </p>
        <p>“This is an everyday occurrence. This is the level of public perception today. What will change if you run
            away from this situation? If you don't stand up for yourself, who will?”</p>
        <p></p>

    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>In March 1987, my alma mater, Oku High School Niirada, finally closed after thirty-two years of service,
            bidding farewell to its last graduates. This high school was unique in the world, as it was founded
            exclusively for people affected by leprosy.</p>
        <p>The issue of amending the Leprosy Prevention Law, which came into effect in 1953, had been the subject of
            intense campaigning since the previous year. The opportunity to pursue higher education had been a
            long-standing demand of the patients. The proposed amendment to the Leprosy Prevention Law included
            provisions from Article 75, paragraph 2, of the School Education Law in Article 14, paragraph 2. The law
            eventually guaranteed the right to education at the upper secondary level, a right that had previously been
            denied to those affected with leprosy.</p>
        <p>The school opened in September 1955. The front-page article in the 1 October issue of the Zenkankyo (National
            Hansen's Disease Patients' Council) News illustrated the high expectations of patients across the country.
            At the opening ceremony, Kensuke Mitsuda, a recipient of the Order of Culture, congratulated the attendees,
            spoke as follows: 'I hope that the school will be a leader for Hansen's disease sufferers around the world.'
        </p>
        <p>I also studied at the school for five years. Attending a four-year high school for five years meant that
            during my time at the school, I studied while undergoing 12 plastic surgeries. This resulted in not having
            enough credits for graduation, necessitating an additional year of study. The 'academic truths' learned in
            the schools of this closed society taught us about ideals and realities that were too far apart.
            Paradoxically, it was the 'best educational environment' for adolescents with a desire to learn. Every
            chapter and sentence of the textbooks and every word spoken by the teachers soaked into my being, and I
            learned in my daily classroom life how "learning, truth, human rights, peace, and equality" were tainted by
            falsehoods.</p>
        <p>There is a song that encouraged me when I was lost on the road, adrift among people, and confused about
            myself. It is the Oku High School Niirada School Song. The song is the starting point of my heart.</p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <pre>
    The sky is clear above the green island, 
    The Seto Sea leading to the world. 
    Ideals stand high for young men and women, 
    Here in Niirada, we stand united. 
    There is hope for us who are learning.

    Red-tiled roofs shine in the setting sun. 
    The sound of the bell echoes in our hearts. 
    Our mission is weighty, young people, 
    While seeking the truth of eternity. 
    We, who are learning, carry pride.

    The scent of the beach breeze on the rugged shore, 
    White walls reflected in the morning sun. 
    Our vows are resolute, young men, 
    Seeking the light of peace. 
    We, who are learning, find encouragement.
            </pre>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>In the spring of 1987, the Executive Committee for the School Closure Commemoration Project sent a
            commemorative book, "Niirada," in a box with a cloth cover. According to the record in the book, there were
            307 graduates of the school, of whom 280 returned to society. </p>
        <p>When I looked through the book carefully, I found its contents were truly strange for a publication
            commemorating the closure of a school.</p>
        <p>At the end of the book, there is an eight-page list of names of past heads of school, head teachers, staff,
            administrative staff, and prefects, along with their addresses. However, the names of the 307 graduates, who
            are supposed to be the main characters, are not mentioned anywhere－not even in a single line. </p>
        <p>The school's social position was unique, but as the publication marking the end of its history, it was too
            "symbolic." Furthermore, the photographs throughout the pages are also distinctive. </p>
        <p>The photographs are mainly taken from a distance or from behind. The photographs used in the near-front view
            are treated with a printing technique known as the "ten-thousand-line treatment" to make it impossible to
            identify the people in the photographs.</p>
        <p>In other words, the names and faces of 307 people were erased from the school closure commemorative
            publication. </p>
        <p>It is too sad to call it a 'foolish act.' </p>
        <p>Thirty-two years ago, people affected by leprosy all over the country were supposed to have left their dreams
            for the next generation and prepared opportunities for young energy to learn from the suffering of their
            past lives. </p>
        <p>It must have been to train people to break the "unjustified social discrimination" against leprosy. </p>
        <p>Of all things! 307 people gave a brilliant answer in the 32nd year by erasing their names and faces. </p>
        <p>The 'soul' of a group that has been continuously marginalized will remain closed forever.</p>
        <p></p>
