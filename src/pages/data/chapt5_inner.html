            <p>On the floor of the ship's vault, passengers greet each other, having spent a day and a night on the edge of each other's beds. </p>
            <p>In the third-class cabin at the bottom of the ship, there were few sights of people relaxing. Some were anxious, mentioning that it was their first time on "the mainland.” Others were engaged in conversations about trains and making a fuss. A group of people with maps spread out was clustered around a man who claimed to have traveled to the mainland several times. </p>
            <p>Passengers are initially relieved to discover that both sides consist of Okinawan residents. However, no Okinawan dialect is heard in the cabin. It is as if the cabin is sealed off, and an unfamiliar common language is being spoken. </p>
            <p>I was covered with a blanket, with only my face showing. A regular engine noise is transmitted to my body as I lie there. </p>
            <p>Occasionally, with each loud pitch, my father's cross-legged knees touch my shoulders through the blanket. </p>
            <p>My father and I do not eat any of the three meals served on the ship. The phrase, "Both the boy and I have been struck by seasickness," is repeated three times. </p>
            <p>Neither he nor I are seasick. </p>
            <p>After he refuses to eat, his voice whispers to me, "Almost there. We're almost there. Patience."</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>“The Naha Maru will soon arrive at Kagoshima Port on time. The ship is now sailing in Kinko Bay. Please make sure to fill out the forms that have been distributed to you once again. Please hand these forms to the staff one by one as you leave the ship. Please have your passport ready as well.” </p>
            <p>When the ship's announcement is made, there is a renewed flurry of activity in the cabin. </p>
            <p>Another announcement follows. </p>
            <p>“The officers will now visit your cabins for quarantine. Please have your quarantine papers ready and wait.” </p>
            <p>My father grabs my arm again. I can feel the tension in his arm. </p>
            <p>My father and I both enter the stream of people in line in front of the quarantine officer. Of course, I have not forgotten to cover my hands with the overcoat I hold in front of my chest. </p>
            <p>“You and your child are together, right? Do you have a fever, diarrhea, or any other health problems?” </p>
            <p>The quarantine officer asks, as he followed along with the documents in his white-gloved hand. </p>
            <p>“No, we are both fine!” my father says. </p>
            <p>His voice is loud. “Yes, </p>
            <p>the next one!” The quarantine officer stamps "quarantine" on my father's and my documents. Blue ink smears out from the edge of the circle. </p>
            <p>The line is soon behind the father and son. The father smiles for the first time as he steps out of his cabin, runs up to the deck, and sits down.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>A semicircle of people surrounded the ramp and greeted us at the quay at Kagoshima Harbor. Both the welcomers and the disembarking passengers stretched out their necks, checking each other out, rushing toward each other, and calling each other by name. </p>
            <p>The semicircle order that had been maintained began to collapse. From the frayed spot, a vertical line continued in the direction of Kagoshima Station.</p>
            <p>As I was going down the ramp with my father, who was holding the trunk in both hands, I heard a voice from the crowd say, “Mr. Toshio Iha, here I am. Mr. Iha.” A voice called out to us. A tall man in his forties greeted us. </p>
            <p>“I am Yamada. You must be tired. Mr. Ishigaki asked me to show you around. Toshio, I'm glad you came. Isn't the boat trip tiring?” he said. </p>
            <p>“No, I was fine,” I said. </p>
            <p>To be honest, I was hungry anyway. I thought I was going to fall to my knees. I could still feel the vibrations of the boat's rocking throughout my body. </p>
            <p>“Mr. Yamada, is there someplace we can eat?” </p>
            <p>My father's words made me very happy. </p>
            <p>“It would take nearly three hours by boat and bus to reach the hospital, so let's have an early lunch. There is a cafeteria in the waiting room of Nankai Yusen (mail boat). That would be good,” Mr. Yamada said.</p>
            <p>It was then that I first encountered natto (fermented soybeans), which was served with the set meal. </p>
            <p>“Dad, this is rotten,” I said. </p>
            <p>Mr. Yamada, who was watching this exchange, laughed with his stomach in his hands. </p>
            <p>“Toshio, that is natto, a fermented soybean food. I was surprised at first, too, but…” he explained carefully, still smiling.</p>
            <p>My father and Mr. Yamada continued talking as they ate. </p>
            <p>“I have the same disease as Toshio. I am a teacher, but I came to Kagoshima on a one-year sick leave. I had some problems with treatment in Okinawa…” he said. </p>
            <p>My father did not ask any questions concerning Mr. Yamada. I listened to their conversation, thinking that my father was caring as much as he could.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>Nankai Yusen (a mail boat) crosses Kinko Bay and heads from Kagoshima Port to Tarumizu. </p>
            <p>“That is Sakurajima.” </p>
            <p>From my textbook, I had assumed that Sakurajima was an active volcano, billowing out plumes of smoke and pillars of flame, but I was surprised to see only a gentle trail of smoke at the top. </p>
            <p>The boat arrived at Tarumizu Port in about 35 minutes. From Tarumizu, we took a bus to “Kanoya and then another bus to Hoshizuka Keiaien. Kanoya is where the base for the suicide squad was located. More than 1,000 young men who scattered in the skies over Okinawa took off from here.” </p>
            <p>My father nodded quietly at Mr. Yamada's explanation.</p>
            <p>Kanoya City is in the center of the Osumi Peninsula, surrounded by the Takakuma Mountains to the north and the Kimotsuki Mountains to the southeast. The Kimotsuki Plain, where Kanoya City is located, extends diagonally between these two mountain ranges. The area around the Hansen's Disease Sanatorium was called Airano.</p>
            <p>The Hoshizuka Respect Garden, located in the middle of a field and surrounded by tall cypress trees, was distinctly different from the small private compound forests that dotted the surrounding area. </p>
            <p>As we got off the bus, a straight road cut through the farmland to the main gate, with the cypress fence only interrupted at the entrance to the park. </p>
            <p>My father stopped along the way, picked up a pinch of soil from the field beside the road, and put it in his mouth.</p>
            <p>"The soil is soft, but it's surprisingly thin, isn't it?" my father said. </p>
            <p>"Yes, the soil here is on the Shirasu Plateau, and only sweet potatoes and rapeseed can grow here," Mr. Yamada said.</p>
            <p></p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Yaeo Ishigaki, my father, and I were at the office counter of the sanatorium. </p>
            <p>"Mr. Ishigaki, it's not good that you brought him here so suddenly. I've heard about it, but we also have some preparations to make. We are in contact with the main office, and we haven't even reached the stage of obtaining approval..." the staff said. </p>
            <p>"That's a strange situation. Hasn’t there already been tacit approval and acceptance between the local government and this sanatorium?" Mr. Ishigaki said. </p>
            <p>"The Ministry of Health and Welfare has shown some understanding of this issue, but since Okinawa is still under U.S. military control, we have to seek instructions from the Ministry of Health and Welfare..." </p>
            <p>"Isn't it strange that they are suddenly bringing up procedural argument? How long do we have to wait? That's why Okinawan children have no choice but to resort this." </p>
            <p>Mr. Ishigaki's voice sounded irritated. </p>
            <p>"This child escaped from Okinawa Airakuen, didn't he? There are various matters that need to be settled between the two parties." </p>
            <p>"So, are you planning to deport him?" </p>
            <p>"I didn't say that." "He is right in front of you!" </p>
            <p>At the counter of the office, a loud exchange of words continued. On the other side of the glass window, the staff stood up and listened. </p>
            <p>"What’s going on? What happened?" a petite woman who had broken through the circle of employees called out. </p>
            <p>The staff member at the counter was constantly telling the woman about what had happened so far. As she listened to his explanation, I could see the woman's expression change. </p>
            <p>"So, what are you going to do?" </p>
            <p>Her tone was almost a choking question. </p>
            <p>"Well, there are several matters we need to address." </p>
            <p>"What kind of procedures?" </p>
            <p>"Even if you say that, we still need to follow certain procedures..." </p>
            <p>What kind of person is she, anyway? </p>
            <p>I wondered for a moment. </p>
            <p>"Have you given any thought to what this child went through to get here? So... are you planning to send him back to Okinawa?" the woman said. </p>
            <p>"No. No, I have the documents..." the staffer replied, stammering. </p>
            <p>"Documents? What documents? If you need me to write that, I will. This boy needs to be treated in a sanatorium. I am a doctor, and I just diagnosed him. Is that all right?" </p>
            <p>She is a female doctor. </p>
            <p>The nameplate on her chest read "Matsuda." </p>
            <p>Oh, this is Dr. Nami Matsuda... </p>
            <p>"We abandoned Okinawa during the war and its aftermath. If you refuse to accept this boy now, it will be another abandonment Okinawa of Okinawa!" </p>
            <p>She sounded as if she were shouting. </p>
            <p>The arrival of Dr. Matsuda changed the situation at the office counter. </p>
            <p>On March 8, 1960, the doors of the National Sanatorium Hoshizuka Keiaien opened for me. Dr. Matsuda told my father, </p>
            <p>"Father, thank you for traveling so far from home. Your child is indeed in our care. Please go home and don't worry about anything." </p>
            <p>My father repeatedly bowed his head to Dr. Matsuda, saying, "Please." </p>
            <p>"I haven't heard your name yet," she said. </p>
            <p>"I'm Toshio Iha," I replied. </p>
            <p>"Yes, Mr. Iha. Toshio, you should study hard here," she advised. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>"Keiaien accepts Susumu safely." </p>
            <p>An express telegram was sent to Okinawa Airakuen informing them of the news. </p>
            <p>It was past five o'clock, and the early spring sun was beginning to set in Shirano. I watched my father leave, and he kept looking back many times. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, take care of yourself." </p>
            <p>"Thank you, Dad," I said.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>Dr. Nami Matsuda, who was at Okinawa Airakuen during World War II, had encountered the Battle of Okinawa.</p>
            <p>In 1944, after the air raid on October 10th in Okinawa, the leprosy sanatoria were also attacked by the U.S. military without exception. Yagaji Island was adjacent to the submarine base Unten Harbor, and the neatly lined up hospital buildings were mistakenly thought to be military facilities, resulting in particularly severe attacks. Approximately 1000 bombs and rocket-propelled grenades, 100 ship's guns, and 100,000 machine-gun rounds rained down on the leprosy patients. Patients whose hospital buildings had been burned to the ground had to flee the war in air-raid shelters set up in five locations within the sanatorium, accommodating 200 people. She also had to run around in the shelters while encouraging her patients. The sanatorium's director, Kou Hayata, who predicted the sanatorium's doom in the face of the fierce U.S. military attack, opened the sanatorium's doors to patients who wished to return home.</p>
            <p>Commander Nimitz, who occupied Okinawa, issued Military Orders No. 115<sup><a href="#1">*1</a></sup> and 116<sup><a href="#2">*2</a></sup> on February 8, 1946. The purpose of these orders was to rehouse leprosy patients who had been displaced by the war and to prohibit them from entering leprosy sanatoriums. Again, leprosy patients in Okinawa were subjected to military-led incarceration. Thus, in Okinawa, they experienced, directly and indirectly, "forced internment by the military," an experience unprecedented anywhere in the world.</p>
            <p>On February 10, 1947, Special Decree No. 13<sup><a href="#3">*3</a></sup> was issued. The U.S. military government's leprosy control program was now established. On February 19, the sanatorium authorities notified patients of the special decree<sup><a href="#4">*4</a></sup> in connection with the decree.</p>
            <p>The first paragraph of the prohibition stated, "Escapees and those who cause them to escape shall be punished by death." </p>
            <p>Later, on July 5, 1949, the U.S. military government issued Special Proclamation No. 32, which rescinded Articles 7, 8, and 9 of the Prohibition. </p>
            <p>The U.S. military government's postwar treatment proclamation did not only affect leprosy patients but also ordered the forced eviction of all residents of the Ryukyu Islands. </p>
            <p>Therefore, Director Hayata, Medical Director Matsuda, and Chief Nurse Nishizaki Chika, all of whom were not residents of the Ryukyu Islands, were forced to leave Airakuen in 1948. </p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>The entrance examination for this year had already finished in January. Therefore, I had to wait at Hoshizuka Keiaien until the next year's examination.</p>
            <p>The dormitory was divided into four rooms for the young men. As a result of discussions by the community association and the school, I was allowed to attend classes at the Hoshizuka branch of Oaira Junior High School for only five subjects: Japanese, mathematics, social studies, science, and English, which were the subjects required for the entrance examination to Oku High School.</p>
            <p>During the year I spent at Keiaien, I was surprised at how different it was from Okinawa Airakuen. One of the differences was the attire of the medical staff during treatment. I had never seen the bare skin of the doctors and nurses in the sanatorium before. </p>
            <p>At Okinawa Airakuen, the medical staff wore white caps, large masks with only the eyes showing, white coats, surgical rubber gloves, and rubber boots. This somehow made me believe that my disease was such a terrible illness, and this awareness always weighed heavily on me. Now, there were nurses in front of me, without gloves, without rubber boots, without masks, with the faces of living human beings.</p>
            <p>My chart on the desk clearly showed my real name, Toshio Iha. </p>
            <p>"Mr. Iha, let's take your pulse," a nurse said. </p>
            <p>My heart was beating like it was about to burst as her bare fingers took my pulse. </p>
            <p>"Beautiful hands," I thought. </p>
            <p>My eyes stopped on her white fingers. ...Suddenly, my own male organ began to erect. I was ashamed, but shamefully, I found myself conscious of the opposite sex for the first time. </p>
            <p>Finally, it had been about five days since my trip to Kagoshima.</p>
            <p>I was invited to Mr. Ishigaki's room, saying, "I have some good news." </p>
            <p>Mr. Ishigaki's house is located in a married couple's house. It is a row of row houses with the same shape. Each room has a six-mat room with a kitchen, and each room has a well-maintained flowerbed in front of it. The daffodils in the flowerbeds looked as if they were floating in the light leaking through the glass doors.</p>
            <p>As I was invited to dinner, I was asked about the difference between Airakuen and Keiaien, and I told the guise of the medical staff first. </p>
            <p>"Well, it hasn't been that long since we changed to the way we do things here. Let me show you something interesting," he said. </p>
            <p>Mr. Ishigaki pulled out a green file notebook from the bookshelf. Inside were newspaper clippings and booklets, and on the page indicated was a discolored sheet of galley paper.</p>
            <p>"This is the 'Guidelines for Outsiders and Staff Entering and Leaving the Patient's Area of Residence.' It is much simplified now. In the long history of Japan's leprosy sanatoriums, not a single case of infection has been reported by sanatorium employees, and some people have even claimed that this is due to the fact that such strict infection control measures are enforced when coming into contact with patients... With the validation of the times, this error is gradually being corrected," he said.</p>
            <p>It stated the following... [the text continues]</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>[Guidelines for entering and leaving the patient's area of residence]</p>
            <ol>When entering a patient's area:
            <li>Take off your clothes in the changing room and put on monpe (women’s work pants which are wide and easy to move) in the next room.</li>
            <li>Put on socks and boots in the next room.</li>
            <li>Put on a jacket, hat, and mask in the next room.</li>
            <li>After inspection, enter the patient's living area.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>When leaving the patient area:
            <li>Wipe shoes with a shoe mat soaked in a disinfectant solution.</li>
            <li>Disinfect hands.</li>
            <li>Take off your jacket and hat in the next room.</li>
            <li>Take off your mask in the next room.</li>
            <li>Take off socks and boots in the next room.</li>
            <li>Soak feet in a disinfectant solution in the next room and disinfect hands twice.</li>
            <li>Wipe with mercury sublimate gauze in the next room.</li>
            <li>Take off monpe in the next room and soak feet in Lysol solution.</li>
            <li>Take a bath and change all clothes. Gargle with a disinfectant solution.</li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>"I guess they still adhere to this guideline-like philosophy at Okinawa Airakuen," he said.</p>
            <p>I added, "I was also surprised at the lack of patrols and the freedom to come and go as one pleases, both inside and outside this sanatorium."</p>
            <p>When there is a regular movie night held at the public hall in Keiaien, residents of the neighborhood compete with the patients entering the sanatorium for seats and stand in line to watch the movie.</p>
            <p>Just before the regular movie night in Okinawa, the staff-only seats were disinfected each time.</p>
            <p>The children were so thorough that they knew the connection between the disinfection and the movie night, saying, “I'm glad brother Susumu, staff disinfected the seats today, so we can watch the movie.”</p>
            <p>“Why is it so different?”, I asked.</p>
            <p>“The people here are full-time farmers and not that wealthy. The sanatorium is the only place in this neighborhood where one can experience the fragrance of culture. The knowledge that leprosy is a terrible disease disappears with daily contact and time because the wisdom gained through daily interactions and experiences is more valuable than mere information. I guess human wisdom has overcome the barriers of this wall and that wall. Perhaps the biggest contributor is the desire to be able to watch movies for free...”, he said.</p>
            <p>After saying this, Mr. Ishigaki smiled. I hoped this day would come to Okinawa as well.</p>
            <p>“And I have good news for you today!”</p>
            <p>He had a big smile on his face.</p>
            <p>“Toshio, your juniors are coming after you,” he said.</p>
            <p>“Really?”, I said.</p>
            <p>“It's still unofficial, but for now, the Patient's Association has decided to accept it. Good for them,” he said.</p>
            <p>“When?”</p>
            <p>“Two weeks from now. Three patients will be admitted here, two to Kikuchi Keifuen in Kumamoto Prefecture, and one to Oshima Seishoen in Kagawa Prefecture.”</p>
            <p>“Thank you very much. Thank you very much.”</p>
            <p>I thanked him again and again.</p>
            <p>The staff member who communicated with us at the sanatorium office was also working hard at this time to open a route to higher education for child patients in Okinawa.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>The "escape" or personal travel to the mainland continued with nine people before me and nine after me. From 1962, an agreement was reached between the authorities, the sanatorium community association on the mainland, and the Airakuen community association, and a "tacit approval" route was opened, and 13 people were allowed to leave. This unofficial travel method, which forced many sacrifices on child patients, finally came to an end in 1964 when the Japanese and Ryukyu government officially agreed to conduct on-site examinations in Okinawa, which had been a longtime dream of mine since 1965. </p>
            <p>The local examination program came to an end in 1980 when the last child took it, bringing the total number of children who traveled under official responsibility to 38. The total number of children with leprosy from Okinawa who got the chance to study more totaled 71, although the method of travel to mainland Japan varied, ranging from escape to tacit approval to official recognition, in order to obtain opportunities for study. This accounts for more than 20% of the 307 graduates of Okayama Prefectural Oku High School who were children with leprosy from Okinawa.</p>
            <p>Under the U.S. military regime, measures to combat leprosy in Okinawa centered on the policy of isolation. In 1958, the 7th International Leprosy Conference was held in Tokyo, and Colonel Irven H. Marshall, Director of the Social Welfare Department of the Okinawa Civil Government, who attended the conference, stated in a newspaper immediately after returning to Okinawa that "the Leprosy Prevention Law is unnecessary," suggesting a change in medical policy regarding leprosy in Okinawa. This sudden statement was dubbed the "Marshall whirlwind" and sent shock waves through all concerned. </p>
            <p>The Social Problems Subcommittee of the Seventh International Leprosy Congress resolved to "recommend that the government abandon its policy of forced isolation wherever it is still adopted." This resolution was a direct repudiation of the leprosy treatment policy of the host country, Japan.</p>
            <p>On August 26, 1961, the Ryukyuan government promulgated Okinawa's own "Hansen's Disease Prevention Law," which stipulated "provisions for release or discharge" and "provisions for home medical care." However, this law was only given a life of 11 years. With the reversion of Okinawa to the mainland in 1972, the law also reverted to the Japanese Leprosy Prevention Law (repealed in 1996), which went against the prevailing global world.</p>

            <p>My best friend, Ryuji, was also a member of the Kagoshima group. </p>
            <p>"You're terrible, you disappeared without saying a word," he said. </p>
            <p>As soon as we met, he gave me a big smack on my back. </p>
            <p>As soon as we settled into our room, I received news about A, who had been in the same class with me until the eighth grade. He had transferred to Yomitan Junior High School in his hometown from the new term of his third year of junior high school to prepare for the entrance examination to Yomitan High School. However, A was rejected from Yomitan High School. Tokumatsu Makabe, the headmaster of Yomitan Junior High School, was suspicious of the rejection of a student who had excelled in both academics and sports, and his investigation revealed the reason for the rejection. The reason was that the certificate issued by the leprosy sanatorium stated that he was "mildly cured" instead of "completely cured."</p>
            <p>At that time, a certificate was issued to those who were cured of leprosy upon their reintegration into society, but the phrase "Leaving the hospital with mildly cured" was used as the reason for the rejection of the certificate. </p>
            <p>The principal, Mr. Makabe, did not leave the issue of the rejection ambiguous. He questioned society about the high school's mishandling of the issue and its insight into the field of education. As a result, the "Yomitan High School rejection issue" became a social problem. </p>
            <p>Once issued, Yomitan High School's "rejection" was never overturned, but another private high school opened its doors to him, saying that they would "gladly welcome Mr. A" into their school. </p>
            <p>"He must have been devastated," I said. </p>
            <p>"I thought so too, and wrote to him right away. He encouraged me by saying, 'Don't worry, you guys will do your best in the Naichi (mainland),'" Ryuji said. </p>
            <p>According to subsequent news, A was able to enter high school. While still in school, he was chosen to be a torchbearer for the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>Ryuji and I continued to prepare for the examinations at our desks. I attended school only for the five subjects of the examination and was allowed to take remedial classes in the rear seats of the classroom. </p>
            <p>Around seven o'clock in the evening, we would always take a break from our studies and lie on the floor, waiting eagerly for the sound of the mandolin. We used to hear the mandolins coming from the next room. </p>
            <p>It was then that I first heard "Troika," "On Lake Baikal," and "Songs of the Steppe." The strings trembled. They overlapped with my father's sanshin (Okinawan three-stringed guitar). </p>
            <p>Mr. Yasuhito Asato always plays his mandolin at the same time. When he returned to the sanatorium after finishing the cooking work, he would sit down in the hallway with a twisted hand towel on his head and play for nearly 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>At the time, all sanatorium residents received a monthly subsidy of 500 yen. We used the money to purchase study books and school supplies, and then it would almost run out. </p>
            <p>“Have some of this while you study.”</p>
            <p>Sometimes Mr. Asato came to our room and threw in sweets and other snacks in a very curt manner. He would buy them for us with the small amount of money he earned from his work in the sanatorium. </p>
            <p>I have another unforgettable memory about Mr. Asato. It must have been around mid-August because I heard a Bon dance song on the wind. “Toshio, you'll go crazy if you study all the time. I'll show you something good tonight,” he said.</p>
            <p>At dusk, I was taken out to a field on the outskirts of the north. It was not used that much and was covered with summer grass, except for a small area in the back of the field. </p>
            <p>“Here, here, lie down in it and listen carefully,” he said.</p>
            <p>At the place indicated, summer grass, growing waist-high, was growing all around. The heads of the stems had yellow buds on them. From the ground where they lay side by side, I could feel the lingering heat of summer, which had not yet fully exhaled. </p>
            <p>“This is the evening primrose. It is usually called evening grass (waiting for evening). When the sun goes down and the moon rises, the flowers begin to open all at once,” he said. </p>
            <p>I followed his example and lay down with my right arm resting on my pillow. </p>
            <p>“This flower blooms while crying...” he said. </p>
            <p>“Flowers cry?” I asked. </p>
            <p>“Yes, they cry in competition with each other...” he also said. </p>
            <p>I wanted to hear the evening primrose cry. </p>
            <p>I could hear it. </p>
            <p>It was a rustling sound, not unlike the sound of the wind. </p>
            <p>“Oh, I hear it! The evening grass is crying!”</p>
            <p></p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>The winter sky was high and clear on January 20, 1961, the day of the examination. </p>
            <p>On the same day at the same time, entrance examinations were held at sanatoriums in Aomori, Miyagi, Gunma, Tokyo, Shizuoka, Okayama, Kagawa, Kumamoto, and Kagoshima. </p>
            <p>Ryuji and I left our rooms one hour before the examinations were to begin at 8:30. </p>
            <p>The Hoshizuka branch of the Oaira Junior High School was located on the west side of the school, across the valley and about a 15-minute walk from the general patient area. </p>
            <p>As I made my way through the cedar grove, frost pillars made a crunching sound under my feet. </p>
            <p>Usually on these paths to and from school, Ryuji and I would chat without reservation, but today we remained silent. </p>
            <p>Just before entering the classroom, I called out to Ryuji. </p>
            <p>“Let's go for it.” </p>
            <p>“All right,” he said. </p>
            <p>All eight students' nervous faces were lined up in the classroom. The bell signaled at 8:30, and the examiner said, </p>
            <p>“Then, please begin the questions. The first subject is Japanese. First, please write down your name without forgetting it.” </p>
            <p>At the sound of the examiner's voice, we all reached for the test papers that had been handed out to us. </p>
            <p>In a chair at the podium sat the examiner from the Okayama Board of Education, looking down at us. Principal Kazutoshi Morimoto was present for all test subjects and circled around the examinees. And from time to time, he peered into the test papers that we were writing on. </p>
            <p>All the exams were over: math, social studies, and science. </p>
            <p>As soon as the exam was over, Mr. Omura stood up tall and jokingly said, “It's over. It's over. Farewell to the agony of my boyhood!” </p>
            <p>After the exam, we were called to the principal's office one by one for an informal review of our performance. </p>
            <p>“Iha-san, you did a great job.” </p>
            <p>The principal, Mr. Morimoto, always addressed Ryuji and me as "san," distinguishing us from the other students, and he did so today as well. </p>
            <p>“Yes, thank you very much,” I said. </p>
            <p>On the way home, Ryuji was excited. </p>
            <p>“We’ve done very well, don't worry. Shall we go to Kanoya tomorrow? I heard that 'The Migratory Bird with the Guitar' was being screened there,” he said.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>The result of the examination came on February 20. </p>
            <p>The principal, Mr. Morimoto, was flustered in front of me. He said that although the names of the other seven applicants were on the notification form, my name was missing. </p>
            <p>He said, “That's strange. I can't believe Mr. Iha isn't listed... I'm inquiring with Okayama right now to see if there are some mistakes.” </p>
            <p>“Failed? Did I fail?” I thought. </p>
            <p>All my strength left me at once. </p>
            <p>I was in my room, staring at the ceiling. Ryuji was next to me, repeating. </p>
            <p>“It's not right... There must be some mistake.” </p>
            <p>I traced several possible causes. That's it! It must be that thing! I could only think of one thing.</p>
            <p>The examiners were required to submit a written report on the health status of our enrollment status. Dr. Matsuda, who diagnosed me, was mumbling as she filled in the findings form. </p>
            <p>“The high school is a boarding school, so it might be difficult for you to live among such energetic students...” </p>
            <p>Dr. Matsuda expressed some concern. </p>
            <p>- Total loss of function in both hands and fingers, drooping of both wrists and the left ankle, requiring special attention -. </p>
            <p>“That's it. That's all I can think of. Bodily functions were the problem. But that couldn't be it...” </p>
            <p>In my head, I was thinking about "physical reasons". </p>
            <p>Gradually, an unspeakable rage began to rise in my chest.</p>

            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <pre>
    Dear Okayama Prefectural Board of Education,
    Please forgive my rudeness in writing to you directly. 
    My name is Toshio Iha, and I applied to Okayama Prefectural Oku High School from Kagoshima. 
    Today, I was notified that I was not accepted by the school. 
    Kazutoshi Morimoto, principal of Ohkirara Junior High School Hoshizuka Branch, was present at the January 20 examination, and he too said, “Iha's test results were in no way inferior to the other students. I don't understand why he failed the exam this time.”
    I myself am confident about my performance in the exam. 
    I am really not satisfied with the result of this rejection. 
    When we inquired directly to Oku High School about the reason for the rejection, they were unable to give us any answers. 
    What was the purpose for the establishment of the Niirada Class of Oku High School in the first place? To provide equal educational opportunities to those who suffer from leprosy as citizens of Japan? Wasn't the purpose to realize the concept of the Fundamental Law of Education?
    In order to realize this spirit, the new Leprosy Prevention Law utilized Article 75(2) of the 'School Education Law' and stipulated it as Article 14(2). 
    If the reason for my failure this time is due to the test results, I will study harder and retry next year. 
    If the reason for my failure is due to my physical functions, this is beyond the scope of my efforts and there is nothing I can do about it. 
    I would very much like to know the reason for my failure. 
    This result will allow me to make a clear choice about my future path. However, if I were to be rejected because of the physical findings on my application, I would have no reason to regret it.
    I have done everything on my own, both in middle school and in the group life of the Boys and Girls House. Physical education was no different. Although my physical condition made it impossible for me to be superior to everyone else, I never once gave up on my own participation in physical education class. 
    If it is impossible for me to study at the Niirada Class of Oku High School because of my physical condition, where should I study? 
    Having been closed from a school for people with leprosy, which high school should I go to now? 
    Am I not the one who should be sent to Oku High School? 
    Even though I have a physical disability, I have made various efforts in my own way. 
    Please do not judge me only based on the physical findings on the documents. 
    Please investigate the situation of group life I have spent so far and come to a conclusion.
    Thank you in advance.

        Sincerely yours,
        January 20, 1961
            </pre>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>It was almost midnight when I finished writing the letter. </p>
            <p>Ten days had passed since I posted the letter, and suddenly, Principal Morimoto paid me a visit.</p>
            <p>He said, "Mr. Iha, we may be able to get you an extra pass. I heard that you sent a letter, and a teacher from the Okayama Prefectural Board of Education is here to read it. He wants to examine your life in person, but he asks you to keep it confidential, so, okay? Behave better than usual.”</p>
            <p>“My letter arrived! They heard my appeal!”</p>
            <p>It was a week later. I received a letter of acceptance to the Niirada class of Oku High School. I was the 31st student to be accepted out of a class with a capacity of 30.</p>

            <p>It was 7:30 a.m. on April 5, 1961.</p>
            <p>At the freight yard at Kanoya Station, eight people heading to Okayama and those seeing them off were gathered. Two station attendants holding small red flags stood at a distance across the tracks and occasionally blew a high-pitched whistle when the group swelled up.</p>
            <p>For the students and commuters of the station's hoards, who are accustomed to the scenery of this station on a regular basis, this morning was different from usual, with a crowd of people out of place in the retractable line yard. The distant gazes from the platform were focused on us.</p>
            <p>I was counting the blossoms of the mountain cherry trees, already leafing out and left behind by the season. The eight new students are surrounded by the whole spring.</p>
            <p>“A train will be coming in shortly. Everyone at Keiaien, please leave the yard, it's dangerous!” </p>
            <p>The station attendant shouted. Prompted by this voice, the people seeing off the train began to move to a bus specially prepared for them.</p>
            <p>"Then, Toshio, take care of yourself. Don't be too tall and don't push yourself too hard. Just be natural." </p>
            <p>"Mr. Ishigaki, Mrs. Ishigaki, thank you for your help. I will write a letter." </p>
            <p>Mr. Ishigaki responded to my greeting by raising his hand and immediately followed the line to exit the premises. </p>
            <p>"Toshio, eat this later." </p>
            <p>I held tightly to the indigo-dyed cloth package handed to me by Mrs. Ishigaki. I can smell the seaweed and feel the slight remaining warmth from the package on my chest. </p>
            <p>"Thank you for the past year," I said. </p>
            <p>"Well, get in, get in," </p>
            <p>Mr. Morimoto, the principal, hurried us along. </p>
            <p>A mail truck was waiting to transport us. </p>
            <p>Omura said, putting his foot on the step, "We're mail cargo, I'm fifty-eight kilograms, so I'll need a lot of stamps." </p>
            <p>"Graciously, we're on an imperial train, so we don't need to pay anything at all."</p>
            <p>Kamishiro made fun of a story without a pause. </p>
            <p>The mail track (Oyu 10) was about 12 meters long and three meters wide. The windows were protected from the outside by lattices, and there were two entrances, one on the left side toward the direction of travel and the other at the coupling entrance, each with a sturdy iron door. Inside, there was a wooden floor with built-in shelves on both sides and a toilet at the rear of the car. </p>
            <p>We spread out our rush mats first.</p>
            <p>We hear the sound of the train cars rattling at the couplings, and soon the train begins to move. </p>
            <p>"It is a thirty-six-hour trip to Okayama. Seven successful applicants will board the train from Kumamoto Station at 11:00 this evening. It's a long trip, so we'll all take it easy."</p>
            <p>Principal Morimoto has already taken off his shoes and rolled up his pants. The eight travelers bound for Okayama, who were not allowed to ride in the passenger car, would head for the station in a mail freight car.</p>
            <p>It was a little over an hour to Shibushi Station. Principal Morimoto checked the timetable in his notebook. </p>
            <p>“The train was scheduled to depart from Shibushi at 1:00 p.m., so we still have four hours to go. It's going to be hard to wait here in the station. …I'll go negotiate with the stationmaster. I'll be right back, so don't go outside,” he said.</p>
            <p>After a while, I saw him approaching at a trot through the window of the mail freight car.</p>
            <p>“Hey, you may all go outside. I have been given permission to go outside until 12:00 p.m., but only on the condition that I stay off the coast where there are no houses. Then, everyone, please remember: you must act as a group. You must obey me. Iha san, you are responsible for leading the group. Everyone, be back here by 12:00 p.m. Lunch boxes are already loaded, so we'll take our lunches in here,” he told us.</p>
            <p>I whispered to him. </p>
            <p>“Why don't you just distribute the lunches to everyone and have them eat them on the beach?” </p>
            <p>“That's not allowed. We were told not to throw any garbage outside this car,”</p>
            <p>The coast of Shibushi was divided into two parts by the harbor. The less crowded Yokoze beach on the south side has a gently sloping white beach that hugs the Pacific Ocean.</p>
            <p>Three hours of chasing volleyballs and running around in the surf passed in the blink of an eye. </p>
            <p>“Hey, guys, let's go back,” I said.</p>
            <p>At 1:00 p.m., the mail freight car was hitched to a different freight train and began to run. Inside the rumbling freight car, the principal opened his notebook and began explaining the route to be taken.</p>
            <p>“Everyone, concentrate. From Miyakonojo, the train will take the Yoshito Line to Yoshimatsu Station, where the box lunches will be loaded. The evening meal will be a little later, around 7:00 p.m. From Yoshimatsu, the train will take the Hisatsu Line to Yatsushiro. From Yatsushiro Station, the train is connected to a freight train on the Kagoshima Main Line and arrives at Kumamoto Station. The train will cross the border between Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Kumamoto prefectures. The train will arrive at Kumamoto at 11:00. Do you understand?” </p>
            <p>“I made sure I understood the time of dinner and the time of arrival in Kumamoto!” a student said. </p>
            <p>There was laughter in the train. </p>
            <p>The train continued to run in the darkness. After nine o'clock, everyone was lying down, perhaps tired.</p>
            <p>I stared out through the lattice. Occasionally, a light would appear and disappear in the distance as the train drove away. I strained my eyes to read the station name on the pillar of the station building.</p>
            <p>After passing "Naraguchi" and going to "Isshouchi," I saw a particularly deep darkness plunging into the right side of the train window. </p>
            <p>Whenever the train made a right turn, a shining white band was seen below the train. It appeared and disappeared again and again. </p>
            <p>“This could be a river,” I thought. </p>
            <p>I hurriedly unfolded my map and followed it. “Naraguchi. There it was. Isshouchi. Here it is. Then, the white strip seen below is the Kuma River.”</p>
            <p>As we neared Yatsushiro Station, the outside of the driving away changed from darkness to the brightness of the city. </p>
            <p>“Everybody, get up. Get up! We've arrived at Yatsushiro Station. We'll be at Kumamoto station in about an hour.”</p>
            <p></p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Seven people boarded the train from Kumamoto Station. Three of them were female students: Shinchi, Miyara, and Kakazu were also there. It was the first time in a year that I had met these three.</p>
            <p>The Kagoshima group applauded especially loudly when the female students said, “I am Matsuda,” “I am Hashimoto,” and “I am Inoue.”</p>
            <p>“We were almost suffocated during the 15-hour trip to Kumamoto with just the guys. How gorgeous and wonderful our journey will be from now on!” The crowd cheered for Omura.</p>
            <p>The morning greeted us in the yard of Moji Station. Looking through the window, one sees a surprisingly large number of trains lined up in a row. The yard is filled with so much activity that the earth creaks. We can see trains leaving the yard in a line being pulled by a startup car, as well as freight trains taking a short rest. At the front of the startup car, an attendant in a work uniform is waving a small flag and hanging from the deck to guide the train.</p>
            <p>The glass windows of the cars glistened in the morning sun. </p>
            <p>However, there was an empty space around our mail wagon, and it was parked alone, as if it had been separated from the rest of the group.</p>
            <p>“Well, let's go get some fresh morning air.” Omura and Kamishiro opened the connecting door and went downstairs. “Let's get some fresh morning air.”</p>
            <p>“No, no, no, you can't go out there! You can't go outside!” </p>
            <p>Suddenly, the loud voice of a station attendant could be heard from outside. They rushed into the car and roughly closed the door.</p>
            <p>“It's a miserable thing, isn't it? We're like prisoners, they're watching us so closely,” he said.</p>
            <p>The mail wagons we were riding in remained parked inside Moji Station until after 3:00 in the afternoon. The small mail wagons were pulled by a launch truck and finally started to move out of the yard. They were then coupled to the tail of the passenger train.</p>
            <p>“It is the first time we have been connected to the train human passengers are riding, and it is going to run!” The thought of this lifted my spirits.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="spacer"></p>
            <p>The train had gone to the bottom of the sea and kept running on the Sanyo Main Line. </p>
            <p>"The next stop was Hiroshima. We will stop in Hiroshima for six minutes. Hiroshima, Hiroshima..." </p>
            <p>It was not long after the train stopped. The doors of the coupler opened wildly, and the women peddlers with large wrapping cloths on their backs came in with a rush. </p>
            <p>"Here, this one is empty, this one is good. Come on this way. Excuse me, everyone." </p>
            <p>The ladies began to unload their luggage, calling out to each other. </p>
            <p>The conductor whistled from outside the car and shouted, "Don't get in there, Get out now!"</p>
            <p>The ladies were quickly pulled out. From the conductor's swashbuckling behavior, I could guess what kind of information would be conveyed to them later.</p>
            <p>Soon after, an announcement was made, "This train will be delayed for five minutes." Two station attendants then attached a sign to the glass window of the coupling of the mail wagons. From the inside, the contents of the sign could be read in reverse. </p>
            <p>"Entry is forbidden while contagious disease patients are being transported." </p>
            <p>Everyone was silent for the rest of the trip to Okayama.</p>
            <p>In the car, I devoured the report of the "International Conference of the MTL (Christian Leprosy Relief Society)" in 1954 and the "International Conference on Relief and Social Rehabilitation of Leprosy Patients (Rome Resolution)," which was compiled by representatives of five countries in 1956, including Japan.</p>
            <p>The MTL report was prepared in response to the views of the "WHO Leprosy Special Committee" issued in 1952. </p>
            <p>The composition and outline of the report were as follows: “I. Epidemiology, II. Management, III. Typing, IV. Treatment, and V. Research,” and were the guidelines agreed upon by the international "Leprosy" stakeholders at the time.</p>
            <p>In particular, the moment I saw the section on “II. Management,” I was almost giddy with shock. </p>
            <p>It stated, "Leprosy is not a discrete disease but a general public health problem in leprosy-endemic areas. Leprosy control policies must be established based on the principles of public health without fear and prejudice," and "It is desirable that special leprosy laws be abolished and that leprosy be legislated along the lines of other communicable diseases in general public health regulations."</p>
            <p>The year was 1954, three years before I got sick. </p>
            <p>Leprosy is not a special disease? Special Leprosy Laws Abolished? </p>
            <p>The report astonished me as if heaven and earth had been turned upside down. </p>
            <p>What was it that had been crushing me all this time? What was the meaning of "my leprosy" that had torn the heart of a 14-year-old boy to shreds? </p>
            <p>The "Rome Resolution" sponsored by the Knights of Malta Society was even more striking. </p>
            <p>"Leprosy is already a curable disease; discriminatory laws must be abolished, and awareness-raising activities to eliminate prejudice must be intensified. It was said that the policy of segregation and incarceration should be corrected, and that treatment in general hospitals, home treatment, and reintegration into society should be promoted." </p>
            <p>"What a disaster! Isn't this all the opposite of what is being done in Japan right now? Why in the world are we being humiliated in this car right now?" </p>
            <p>I thought. My body began to tremble. I felt every pore of my body open with anger.</p>
            <p>It is not a story about a future utopia! The world had already been moving before. </p>
            <p>The distance of the line extension from Shibushi to Okayama was 806 kilometers, and even at that time, it took less than 20 hours to run through the city. We were transported for 36 hours to get there. </p>
            <p>Although it was the Japanese National Railways that ran the train, it was the medical administration under the mask of public health that arranged this special schedule.</p>
            <p>The time spent straddling the tracks from Kagoshima to Okayama changed my way of thinking. </p>
            <p>I will surely blow a hole in this unforgivable wall!</p>
