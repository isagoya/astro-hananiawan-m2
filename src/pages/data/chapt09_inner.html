    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>January 1970. At the end of my training period, I received my first salary. The amount was 22,000 yen.
            Finally, the money I had earned with my own effort was in my pay bag. </p>
        <p>I immediately wrote a letter to Akiko that evening. At that time, she had graduated from the National Tama
            Zenshoen Higher Nursing School and was working at a leprosy sanatorium. </p>
        <p>We had seen each other two or three times before while I was still a student at the Central Labor Academy,
            but I had only stared and stopped talking to her. </p>
        <p>-- I am finally able to work on my own and live with my own responsibilities. The issues that led to my
            rejection when I applied for a relationship three years ago have been resolved. I formally apply for a
            relationship. -- </p>
        <p>On the Sunday of that week, after I had written the letter, Akiko came to visit me at the colony. </p>
        <p>“You've done well. Congratulations.” </p>
        <p>After a year and a half of dating, the day came when I asked Akiko's father for his consent to marry her.
        </p>
        <p>The rain had been falling for four days straight in June. In Akiko's room at the nurses'quarters, which I
            visited for the first time, the father and daughter were already facing each other. When I greeted him for
            the first time, his father's stern eyes followed me. I also felt as if I was being blamed for the sound of
            the rain outside, which I could hear through the glass window. </p>
        <p>“When Akiko said she was going to nursing school at the leprosy sanatorium, I couldn't oppose her. Poverty is
            truly a shameful thing. I couldn't say a single word back to my daughter, who was so concerned about her
            parents' financial situation, even when it came to choosing a career path. That was the beginning of Akiko's
            struggles, but now, of all things, this marriage proposal is making her consider the worst possible choice…”
        </p>
        <p>I was speechless. My mouth was dry, and the words I had envisioned in my head wouldn't come out. "Ah..." was
            all I could manage. In front of her father, who folded his arms, slumped his shoulders, and turned his head
            to the side, no matter how much Akiko nudged my knees, my voice had nowhere to go and had to bounce around
            inside my body. </p>
        <p>“Toshio lives his life to the fullest. You always said that a person's worth lies in their sincerity…”</p>
        <p>Despite hearing Akiko's voice as if she were challenging him, I could only gaze into her father's eyes. </p>
        <p>“Don't get carried away by temporary passion. The world... The world is not that easy…” </p>
        <p>“I have no money. I have no standing in the world. I will take good care of your daughter with sincerity. We
            will work together, and I'm sure we will be happy. Please.” </p>
        <p>This was all I could manage to say. The conversation among the three of us fell silent, and the air in the
            room seemed to become dense. </p>
        <p>A knock came from the entrance door. </p>
        <p>“Excuse me. Akiko, the tea is getting a little cold. Let me change it for you.” </p>
        <p>"Thank you. Father, I'd like to introduce her. Ms. Fujisawa. She shares the room with me."</p>
        <p>Her father said with a smile, </p>
        <p>"You have always been a great help to Akiko..Thank you.” </p>
        <p>Ms. Fujisawa, replacing the tea and leaving the room, turned back and clenched her fist in a subtle gesture,
            while Akiko nodded in response. </p>
        <p>“The rain continues, and it's delaying the drying of the concrete. Your mother will have to worry about it
            all over again... and we've only just finished the earthwork on the hill behind the house…” </p>
        <p>“Did the authorities approve the disaster recovery work?” </p>
        <p>“Yes, government work takes time. It takes about a year. I'm sure your mother will be relieved now…” </p>
        <p>Father and daughter engaged in a conversation about their hometown. As they did, I watched the second hand on
            the alarm clock on her desk. </p>
        <p>None of the words I had prepared seemed to take shape. </p>
        <p>How many times had I already said just 'please'? </p>
        <p>Two hours had already passed since the three of us faced each other. </p>
        <p>Akiko's father gripped the tea cup with both hands and drank it all in one gulp. </p>
        <p>Then, after exhaling heavily, he said, “I don't care if both of you die in the field.” We bowed deeply.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>On 12 September 1971, we were to be married. </p>
        <p>Akiko's parents, who had announced that they would allow us to marry but would not attend the wedding, also
            came from Kagoshima. Of course, my parents also came from Okinawa, accompanied by my brother-in-law Yutaka.
        </p>
        <p>On the eve of the wedding, a dinner with both parents was being held at an inn in front of Yoyogi Station in
            a relaxed atmosphere. However, the words of Akiko's drunken father gradually turned on my father like the
            sharpness of a needle. </p>
        <p>“Iha-san. Dogenkotsudesuka (What the hell is going on?). In Kagoshima, a parent who receives a daughter but
            does not come to the daughter's home. It can’t be!” </p>
        <p>“I am sorry. I am a parent who abandoned my sick child once... What kind of face can I put on and ask you to
            give me your daughter as my daughter-in-law? ... I am truly sorry..." </p>
        <p>The father is crestfallen and clenches his fists. </p>
        <p>Oh, that's right. </p>
        <p>On the day he took me to the leprosy sanatorium 14 years ago, those words from my father's mouth came back to
            me. </p>
        <p>“Toshio, there are many brothers and sisters at home... they are all still small..." </p>
        <p>-- He abandoned his son? </p>
        <p>Were those words at that time... </p>
        <p>Was he talking to himself?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>The wedding was organized by the Executive Committee for Celebrating New Beginnings, with Mr. and Mrs. Minoru
            Nomura as the matchmakers, with a membership fee of 1000 yen. </p>
        <p>“I do my best to decline requests to act as a matchmaker, but this one time is special. There are strange
            things that happen, aren't there? I am an old acquaintance of Chozo Hashizume, the man who performed plastic
            surgery on Mr. Iha. My wife and I were also matchmakers for the wedding of Hashizume.” </p>
        <p>The greetings were also quite heartfelt. Our greeting was also more powerful. </p>
        <p>“Leprosy was the catalyst that brought us together. One as a sufferer, one as a caregiver, we talked about
            discrimination, about our way of life, and then we decided to get married. We are not old enough to talk
            about our past. But the price of youth was not cheap enough to forget the tears and anger of the past. The
            bird that sings of spring knows the sword of winter's withering wood. It is in your goodwill that we
            depart." </p>
        <p>The wedding congratulations show how the couple, a former leprosy patient and a person who worked at the
            sanatorium, caused a stir all around them. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <div class="ms-4">
            <p>One man with leprosy and one woman in a position to care for him have been blessed by both parents. The
                couple is blessed by both parents. The wedding takes place amidst the hymns of their teachers and many
                friends with whom they have interacted along the way. </p>
            <p>They build a castle around their transparent love for each other with another love. The many hearts that
                groan under unjustified prejudice and discrimination are penetrated by a single directionality within
                the
                couple. (Kazuoki Shirabe, current President of Tokyo Colony)"</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>"People who have changed our lives, from questioning to determination, from isolation to burning heat.
                People who prepared us to change.
                From the depths of deep questioning of why we live and why they gave birth to us
                To the joy of having lived, to the passion of gratitude and compassion for those who have given us life
                and
                nurtured us.
                Those who have made us leap forward.
                In response to the thousand suns that support us in the turning point of our lives,
                watching over the heights of our flame,
                which now wants to be a corona that soars up!
                To our burning resolve!
                Pour out your living lore. (Shimada Hitoshi, Leprosy Poets' Group)</p>

    <h2 id="the-human-islands">The Human Islands</h2>
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>It was May 1972 when NHK producer Mitsuru Tomizawa visited me. At the time, he was involved in documentary
            programs, and his work was successively selected as one of the year's outstanding productions. </p>
        <p>“I was covering the leprosy issue and was introduced by Mr. Sato, a caseworker at Zenshoen," </p>
        <p>he told me. After only two encounters with Mr. Tomizawa, who spoke to me in a halting manner, we had hit it
            off. </p>
        <p>Films the prejudice and discrimination issues of leprosy as they are. All portrayed through real people."</p>
        <p>"Mr. Iha, why don't you make a national appeal on NHK's 30-minute broadcast?" </p>
        <p>Thus began the production of the documentary 'The Human Islands - A Marriage,' scheduled for broadcast in
            November. </p>
        <p>Akiko strongly objected. </p>
        <p>"For you, it may be a statement of a way of life, but I got married in a normal way. Why is that special?"
        </p>
        <p>However, Akiko finally agreed with the promise that this would be the only time. </p>
        <p>For four months, three television crews were attached to our lives. The filming of the documentary 'The Human
            Islands - A Marriage' went smoothly. </p>
        <p>For the filming of scenes, I visited Nagashima Aiseien in Okayama, where I spent my high school years,
            together with the TV crew. The director of the sanatorium himself welcomed us at Okayama Station. </p>
        <p>"I received a call from the central broadcasting station in Tokyo," he said. </p>
        <p>However, at the entrance of the main office building of Nagashima Aiseien, an argument immediately ensued.
        </p>
        <p>The first thing they said was, "Mr. Iha, please refrain from entering the main building from here. We have
            made special arrangements for you to stay in the patient area..." </p>
        <p>The normally calm Mr. Tomizawa raised his voice. </p>
        <p>"Why? That's not good enough. The purpose of this visit is to follow the patients closely, so we will stay
            there with Mr. Iha." </p>
        <p>"We can't allow that because Mr.Iha is a former patient. Since its foundation, it has been unprecedented to
            accept recovered patients in this main building.” The cameraman, Yoshimura, suddenly started rolling the
            camera. </p>
        <p>"Wait a minute. Stop rolling the camera..." </p>
        <p>After being asked to wait for a while, the meeting of the clerks was held. We were left waiting at the
            doorstep for half an hour. </p>
        <p>Finally, the TV crews and I were allowed into the reception room of the main office building of Nagashima
            Aiseien. We were also allowed to stay at Koufuso flat, which is exclusively for visitors, and to eat in the
            staff cafeteria. </p>
        <p>"Mr. Yoshimura, how could you roll the camera at that time? It was good timing." </p>
        <p>"Oh, that time? The camera wasn't loaded with film yet…"</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>Just before the documentary 'The Human Islands: A Marriage' was scheduled to be broadcast, a TV spot was
            shown, and it was mentioned in the TV columns of newspapers as a topical film. </p>
        <p>Akiko and I waited in front of the TV set for the broadcast. The title backdrop of The Human Islands appeared
            on the screen. </p>
        <p>"What is this? This is different..." </p>
        <p>A message appeared at the bottom of the screen. </p>
        <p>------The planned broadcast of 'A Marriage' has been canceled for certain reasons. Please watch the
            previously broadcast ''XX'.'---- </p>
        <p>Just after another program on ‘The Human Islands’ finished, Mr. Tomizawa called me. </p>
        <p>“I'm sorry. I wasn't strong enough.” </p>
        <p>There were no other words. For some reason, I understood everything from those short words. That there was
            some pressure, and that this person did not yield to that pressure until the very end... </p>
        <p>When I arrived at work the next morning, I was bombarded with phone calls from the newspaper companies. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“This is Suzuki from the ABC News's Society department,” </p>
        <p>“This is Ogawa from the CDC News Society department.” </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>What's going on? Why is a journalist from the society section covering an off-air issue on TV? </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“Why did you request the TV to be canceled at the last minute? I'd like to meet you and interview you
            directly...”, they asked me. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“A request to take the program off the air? Who made the request? Me? Did NHK's PR department make an
            announcement? No, no, I don't know. This morning's newspaper? No, I haven't seen it yet..." </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I hurried to get the newspaper. It was on the society page. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>----'A Marriage' off the air. ---- </p>
        <p>A Marriage, which was the first to feature leprosy, was canceled at his request just before it was aired.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At 10 am, two black taxis were parked in the courtyard of the colony. </p>
        <p>NHK executives from the Culture Department, the Public Relations Department, and the Programming Department
            came. </p>
        <p>They asked for a meeting with me and said, "We are sorry for the inconvenience caused by this incident. I
            have come to apologize to you." </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"First of all, I'd like to ask you what you mean when you said in the newspapers that the program was
            canceled at my request." </p>
        <p>"The press interpreted our press release as they saw fit, and that's how they came up with the story. We
            apologize for any inconvenience caused. We have prepared an alternative plan to halt the broadcast. We would
            like to program a special medical program aimed at eliminating prejudice in educational broadcasting. We
            would very much appreciate your approval." </p>
        <p>The three visitors just bowed their heads and repeated this again and again. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I rejected this offer. Only after several rounds of discussions did the truth about what had led to the
            program's cancellation come to light when I pressed them.</p>
        <p>On the day of the planned broadcast, a person affected by leprosy visited NHK with a representative. </p>
        <p>“The program would have exposed the fact that we were living with leprosy and hiding our past. If that
            happened, we would not be able to live in society as we used to. If we were affected in any way after the
            program is broadcast, we would demand compensation for the damage. We urge you to stop the broadcast." </p>
        <p>The talks were not concluded until just before the film was broadcast. NHK, worried about the anticipated
            social repercussions, decided to cancel the broadcast. </p>
        <p>NHK stated that it would do its utmost to eliminate prejudice in its educational broadcasts. </p>
        <p>The same words were repeated over and over. </p>
        <p>“Prejudice is a social consciousness directed at human beings. That's why the cameras rolled on me, a real
            person.” </p>
        <p>On the fourth visit, Mr. N, the representative of the former patient who had asked for the film to be taken
            off the air, came with them.</p>
        <p>Business cards were exchanged, and Mr. N, who identified himself as a director of the organization, looked at
            me and said, </p>
        <p>“Mr. Iha, if you are a person affected by leprosy survivor, you must understand our suffering. Could you
            please give some consideration to those who hide their past and live in secret?” </p>
        <p>“What do you mean by consideration?” </p>
        <p>“We don't want leprosy to become a public issue. If your hand is shown in the film, it will threaten the
            lives of those who are returning to society with the aftereffects of leprosy. Therefore, can you somehow
            allow us to stop the film?" </p>
        <p>“Our illnesses have been cured.” </p>
        <p>“Medically, yes. But socially, that is not the case. Mr. Iha, you have only been back in society for less
            than a year. You still don't understand the real suffering of people affected by leprosy... If our lives are
            threatened by this broadcast, we will have to take appropriate measures.” </p>
        <p>“What do you mean by 'appropriate measures'? Do you mean what you say about compensation?” </p>
        <p>“That can be included.” </p>
        <p>“Who are you asking for? Is it NHK or me?” </p>
        <p>“We will make a comprehensive decision on that...” </p>
        <p>“Mr. N, I refuse your request. You are concerned about the damage that might be expected after the broadcast,
            but I have already suffered concrete damage due to the cancellation of the broadcast due to your pressure.
            If you want to argue about damages, the demand is on my side, not yours." </p>
        <p>I turned to the NHK executives present. </p>
        <p>“If NHK wants to make a new educational program, that makes sense, so go for it. However, it is not
            reasonable for you to propose this in exchange for the cancellation of a program featuring me. I strongly
            urge you to televise 'A Marriage.'” </p>
        <p>I persistently asked for this airing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>In March of the following year, the documentary 'A Marriage' was finally broadcast in the final episode of
            'The Human Islands.' </p>
        <p>The day after the TV broadcast, I received a visit from Mr. Ishii, the landlord of my flat. </p>
        <p>“I saw it on TV. It was good. Actually, I was suddenly summoned by Mr. K to go and see him, and I'm on my way
            back now. I wasn't sure whether I should inform you or not. 'I heard that Mr. Iha has leprosy,’ he told me,
            'I don't want to stay in the same flat with him, so please get Mr. Iha out of this flat.' I refused this
            unreasonable request... He said, 'If you don't kick him out, we'll leave ourselves,' so I said, 'Well, if
            that's the case, then we have no choice but to cancel the contract this month...’” </p>
        <p>“I'm sorry,” I said. </p>
        <p>“No, no, if there's anything I can do, please come and tell me.” </p>
        <p>After the TV broadcast, my promise of 'just one time' to Akiko was not kept. The media swarmed us. I was so
            empowered that I had lost all concern for my wife. I felt like a knight standing up against prejudice and
            discrimination towards leprosy, and I was totally soaring.</p>

    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>While the recording of "A Marriage" was going smoothly, Akiko went on maternity leave. With that, things
            started to get noisy around her. </p>
        <p>When I returned home, Akiko was lying face down on the table, crying. It seemed that two guests had come, and
            two teacups with leftover drink were still on the table. </p>
        <p>"What's wrong, what happened?" </p>
        <p>After a few moments of sobbing, she finally opened her mouth. </p>
        <p>The visitors were two members of the management committee of the nursery school at work. </p>
        <p>They said they had come to see her before I came back because they couldn't have a calm discussion with me in
            the room. </p>
        <p>“What did they come to say?” </p>
        <p>“... Are we making a mistake? </p>
        <p>They suddenly said to me, </p>
        <p>‘Akiko, are you still going to have children?’ </p>
        <p>They are also women in the medical field, you know. They said such a thing about the life that was about to
            be born. </p>
        <p>I answered, ‘Yes, I will have a baby.’ </p>
        <p>And can you guess what they said?</p>
        <p> ‘Are you going to put your child in our nursery? If you do, your egos will destroy the nurseries that the
            union and local mothers have worked so hard to bring up. You should not make working mothers suffer.’”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“What! How did you respond to that?” </p>
        <p>“Of course, I said, ‘I intend to leave my child in an on-site nursery from the end of my maternity leave.’”
        </p>
        <p>We immediately went into a discussion with two of them. </p>
        <p>“Our nursery is barely getting off the ground. The staff at the sanatorium has knowledge of leprosy... But
            two-thirds of the users are from neighbors who have no medical knowledge whatsoever. There is strong
            opposition, saying they don't want to be in the same nursery as children of former lepers. If these people
            stop using our on-site nursery, the management of it will not be viable. The union will bear some of the
            costs of having your child looked after. We will also introduce you to someone who will support your
            childcare, so please refrain from sending your child to the on-site nursery...” </p>
        <p>We had predicted that there would be some sort of movement over the care of our children to be born in the
            future, but as we thought, even a ray of light was beginning to fade. </p>
        <p>“Wait a minute. Asking our children to go to daycare is not just for childcare. We just want our children to
            grow up normally. Isn't the nursery worth it because our children grow up together? We are not going to ask
            individuals to take care of our children... Besides, my illness has been cured. The medical side, where you
            also work, proved that I was cured and allowed me to return to society. Why can't our child have access to
            the onsite nursery?” </p>
        <p>“It's not about medicine. It's an emotional issue."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Informal negotiations did not proceed favorably. My wife's due date is approaching. We rushed to settle the
            matter so that my wife could have the child in peace. </p>
        <p>A meeting was held with Dr. Arai, the caseworker, Ms. Sato, and us in attendance. </p>
        <p>I can't shake the feeling that it is an unusual situation that the issue of admission to a nursery school is
            being discussed even though the child has not yet been born. The debate between the doctors and the
            directors was heated. However, I was surprised to find that the people expressing opposing opinions were all
            sanatorium staff. </p>
        <p>Suddenly, a drunk sanatorium employee, Mr. C, came in shouting. </p>
        <p>“You won't accept Mr. Iha's child because of opposition from parents other than the staff? All those lines
            are lies! It is you, the sanatorium staff, who are against it. Don't make me laugh. What kind of union
            protects the interests of workers? Akiko, hang in there. I'll protect you even if I'm alone!” </p>
        <p>The sudden intruder's statement caused the union officials, who were the moderators, to turn pale. The
            situation at the parents' association then changed completely. </p>
        <p>The parents' association then agreed by an overwhelming majority that my child would be admitted to the
            school. </p>
        <p>However, the sanatorium officials demanded assurances that I would not enter the patient areas of the
            sanatorium at any time in the future. I bowed my head in agreement to their request. </p>
        <p>“Please take care of my child.” </p>
        <p>Akiko was crying on the way home. </p>
        <p>“Why did you accept that unreasonable request not to go into the patient area? Do you think that by going in
            and out of the patient areas, leprosy is transmitted? And why did you bow down and ask for our children to
            be admitted? I am a trade unionist too! I too have the right to use the on-site nursery..."</p>
        <p>On 2 July 1972, my first child was born. I named my son Ryo. My son started attending an on-site nursery
            after Akiko’s maternity leave. However, some refusals remained, such as not napping next to Ryo and not
            dressing other children only with Ryo's clothes when they ran out of changes of clothes.</p>
        <p>Twelve years later, Ms. M, who had retired from the nursery school, came to Tokyo Colony. When the
            receptionist contacted me and showed her into the reception room, she suddenly put her hands on the table
            and dropped tears. </p>
        <p>She said, “It's been a long time. I really wanted to meet you once and apologize. I am sorry... If only we
            had been more resolute... I am so sorry. I think we broke Ryo's heart. We couldn't refuse the demands of
            some of the mothers.... I am pathetic... I regret it for the rest of my life..." </p>
        <p>As Ms. M bowed her head, I was reminded of the faces of the two women who had opposed Ryo's entry to the
            nursery school. </p>
        <p>Three years later, his younger sister Yui was born and was able to use the same nursery without any problems.
            The nursery was later expanded to accommodate the growing number of children.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>There were only a few days left in 1972. Akiko stared at a point on the ceiling. </p>
        <p>“Let's go and see the completed Hiiragi (Hollywood) flat now. No matter what happens, I will move into the
            Hiiragi flat!” </p>
        <p>A six-family staff abode was built on land adjacent to Tama Zensein. It had a 2DK layout with a bathroom, and
            the rent was 60% cheaper than private flats. The Hiiragi flat tenants were being recruited from the public
            as it neared completion. </p>
        <p>"The colony where Akiko's husband works pays less, so it would be difficult to live in a private flat.” </p>
        <p>Her colleagues had taken the liberty of applying in our names for that open call. The competition was more
            than four times higher. Luckily or unluckily, Akiko Iha's name was among the winners listed on the notice
            board. However, there was a string of withdrawals, and the five applicants who wanted to fill in the
            vacancies never appeared. </p>
        <p>Six months later, we were still the only family to move into Hiiragi flat. At last, the vacancies were
            advertised in the shops of ordinary real estate agencies. </p>
        <p>Since then, the smile disappeared from Akiko's face. After a while, Akiko began to plead with me on every
            occasion. </p>
        <p>“Please don't talk about people with leprosy anymore. Why don't you just be a cripple with a limp?” </p>
        <p>“Our children are getting bigger and bigger. And we can live in the countryside where no one knows about your
            past. You are in a colony, supported by everyone, so you don't know our real suffering now. You always talk
            about ideals and... Look at reality more, open your eyes.” </p>
        <p>Finally, the problems between us escalated into a struggle over how to live. And the gulf between the two
            sides gradually widened. </p>
        <p>In August 1980, we divorced. </p>
        <p>Akiko, Ryo, and Yui returned to Kagoshima. Ryo was eight years old. Yui was just before her fifth birthday.
        </p>
        <p>On 7 August, when I returned home, the children who had always greeted me by jumping up and down at the door
            were gone. </p>
        <p>On the table, there was a note left by Akiko. </p>
        <p>--Thank you for all your long years. I will take only happy days with me. Please don't look for our
            destination until the children come to visit you of their own volition, as promised. </p>
        <p>All the family sounds of the past eight years have gone underground. </p>
        <p>“I'm alone again.”</p>

    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>It was early summer of 1983. Suddenly, I felt a desire to be in the wind at Kazuo Dan's birthplace of
            literature. </p>
        <p>I had visited Fukugon-ji Temple in Yanagawa City and Nokonoshima Island on my own last year. However, this
            time, I decided to accept Matsuo's offer (Matsuo being the executive director of Zencolo and executive
            director of Fukuoka Colony) and headed for Fukuoka.</p>
        <p>“I'll be your guide this time. You should stay at my house and relax."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>As the car passed through Ikinomatsubara in Fukuoka City, Nokonoshima came into view once more.</p>
        <p>“How was Nokonoshima last year?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, I visited Dan Kazuo's villa. There was no sign of anyone living there anymore, but I took the liberty
            of entering through the garden. The view is nice. The ship landing place was below me, and I could see
            Fukuoka City on the other side of the river. ... In that landscape, Dan must have been driven by all kinds
            of pain. People can easily endure the pain of illness. Healing the heart is more difficult. That house was
            full of the passionate flames of the three women... The deceased Ritsuko, Keiko from 'The Woman in the
            Firehouse,' and his wife's. ... I'm sure Dan was always being watched by the three of them and couldn't fit
            in that little house...”</p>
        <p>“Your way of reading books has always been a bit unusual..."</p>
        <p>Is the clear June sky sucking the sea water up into the sky again and again? The distant island shadows and
            townscapes were blurred together, as if seen through a blue silk screen.</p>
        <p>“The Atago Shrine we drove past earlier , I heard it has a special benefit for those who are determined to
            cut something off.”</p>
        <p>“I haven't got enough to throw away.”</p>
        <p>“You have more than you can bear; you can come back if you want.”</p>
        <p>Matsuo teased me in his usual tone.</p>
        <p>“No, thanks.”</p>
        <p>“Overlapping Nokonoshima and jutting out in the haze on the left side is Shikanoshima Island. In front of it
            is Goishibana. Although hidden from view from here, behind it is Nishiurazaki, from which Genkai Island can
            be seen. “</p>
        <p>The wind coming across Imazu Bay from the open car window was hitting me in the face.</p>
        <p>----It was along this route that Kazuo Dan set out for Oda with Ritsuko's urn hanging from his waist and Taro
            on his shoulders.</p>
        <p>----Who in the world will pick up my bones?</p>
        <p>I suddenly had a thought.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“Iha, let's stop off in Akizuki. Because it doesn't take that long to drive on the motorway.” </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Akizuki is a castle town in the mountains north of Amagi City. Surrounded by mountains on all sides, with a
            clear stream dividing the town's center, it was a quiet town, especially as it was a weekday. When we
            entered the ruins of Akizuki Castle, which was once the residence of the Kuroda clan, we found a row of
            cherry blossom trees planted in the Meiji era (1868-1912), which stretched for 700 metres. After climbing
            the stone steps through the rows of cherry blossom trees, the Ote-mon Gate, known as the Niou-standing Black
            Gate, stood proudly.</p>
        <p>“My ancestors were from here. The names of my ancestors are still marked in the Akizuki Local History Museum
            next to the gate. It's a strange thing, isn't it? For some reason, I feel at home when I visit here. The
            ruins of this castle also get crowded during the cherry blossom season, but if you choose the right time of
            year, it's nice and quiet..." </p>
        <p>When we returned from Akizuki Castle, it was already around six o'clock. </p>
        <p>Matsuo's house, which had been a doctor's residence for generations until his father's generation, was
            situated on a hillside overlooking Shingu town from the garden. We were greeted by his wife, who had been
            described as an "old-fashioned, unassertive woman". “We have been looking forward to seeing you,” she said.
            We were shown into the living room, where a low drinking table had already been prepared.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“A 40-year-old man wants to visit the footsteps of the literati; you're naiver than you look. Outlaws and
            ‘The Fire Hose’ (written by Kazuo Dan) don't suit you. Did you get lost in a woman?” </p>
        <p>I was listening to him as I looked at the cups filled to the brim with local sake. I had been wondering about
            the gaze of the Bodhisattva Amitabha Pure Land Kannon, said to be a copy of a mural from Horyuji Temple,
            hanging in the alcove. </p>
        <p>“How long has that painting been there?” </p>
        <p>“It's been hanging since my grandfather's time.” </p>
        <p>“Is it older than the current murals in the Golden Hall of Horyu-ji then?” “It is said that it's a copy of a
            famous Japanese painter, who was a favorite of my grandfather's collection. The eyes of the Kannon
            Bodhisattva see everything through three generations of parents and children. During the pre-war movement to
            abolish Buddhism, various works of art of unknown origin were brought to my grandfather's shop, and this is
            one of the items he bought. The collection is still piled up in the storehouse, unorganized...” </p>
        <p>“It has a nice face...” </p>
        <p>“You're one of the business owners, aren't you? You need to be tougher. There's nothing more unruly than
            temporary sentimentality. There's no such thing as thoroughness for you.” </p>
        <p>“The sound of the waves in the Genkainada Sea has a very long echo...” </p>
        <p>“...Have you heard from the children?” </p>
        <p>“No, no...” </p>
        <p>“Forget about it once and for all. It's been three years, hasn't it?”. </p>
        <p>“Sometimes you should fall in love with a woman. You look like you've got leprosy all by yourself; martyrs
            live smarter lives...” </p>
        <p>“Oh, dear. What are you doing? You haven't even switched on the lights. Welcome. I'm Kayoko. Matsuo is always
            at your service,” his wife came into the room. </p>
        <p>“I'm sorry to barge in on you today,” I said. </p>
        <p>“No, we can't offer you any hospitality, but please make yourself at home.” </p>
        <p>“Thank you.” </p>
        <p>“The sea bream I asked Urayama-san of the Shinko Maru (fishing boat) for has just arrived.” </p>
        <p>“Hey, sake, please. It's dry, but it'll do.” </p>
        <p>“It's a rare thing, isn't it? I can't believe you drink so much sake. Well... You've drunk so much.... I'm
            sorry. He's been looking forward to seeing you for a couple of days. ‘Finally, Mr. Iha said he'd stay at our
            house.’” </p>
        <p>"Did you ask Urayama to... You married in Hakata, you should at least make sashimi (sliced raw fish) of sea
            bream by yourself." </p>
        <p>“How was Akizuki Castle?” </p>
        <p>“It's a nice place.” </p>
        <p>“He was very determined to take you to the ruins of Akizuki Castle, which is related to the Matsuo family...”
        </p>
        <p>“When I told him that Akizuki was the southern limit of the boxwood tree, he composed a nice haiku under that
            black gate.” </p>
        <p>“No, I just thought of something...” </p>
        <p>“Kayoko, hand me that glove compartment. I didn't want to forget it. I've saved the following in my
            notebook.” </p>
        <p>“Here it is.” </p>
        <p>Matsuo turned to his notebook and read aloud the phrase he had written down.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <div class="ms-4">
        <p>Reflecting the moon in her black hair with a comb made of boxwood.</p>

        <p>"Isn't it good? I'm not sure if he's got the girl, he's in love with. Besides, right now he's completely
            captivated by Dan Kazuo." </p>
        <p>"I read your writings when you visited Nokonoshima the other day," Kayoko said. </p>
        <p>"That was just a memorandum." </p>
        <p>"He spent all day yesterday at the Fukuoka Folk Museum. He said he would look for documents on Dan Kazuo for
            you, which are not available in Tokyo." </p>
        <p>"Hey, Iha, let's go down to the beach below. Kayoko, we'll have another drink when we get back..." </p>
        <p>"Are you all right? You're quite drunk." </p>
        <p>Matsuo's feet were firm, even though he had had a lot to drink. </p>
        <p>After a short walk down the winding road, there was a fishing harbor with three fishing boats moored there.
            After about five minutes from the harbor, the quay broke off, and from there we could descend to Shingu
            beach.</p>
        <p>When I gazed into the distance, the lights from the houses on Ainoshima Island, beyond the waves, made me
            imagine fishermen relaxing with their families. "Where do the children live now?" </p>
        <p>"I don't know. I promised not to look for them until they come to visit me..." </p>
        <p>"Forget about the children, okay?" </p>
        <p>"Yes...." </p>
        <p>"Children grow up without parents. Without parents, children grow up even more. That's good. Iha, what was
            that haiku (short poem) that Dan Kazuo wrote on the verge of his death?"</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <div class="ms-4">
        <p>How many nights I listen to the Mogari flute before I meet flowers</p>

            something you can hear with your ears. ... You should catch it with your stomach, yes, your organs..." </p>
        <p>Matsuo's footing is a little wobbly, but we keep walking as far as he can. </p>
