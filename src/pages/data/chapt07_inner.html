    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>I entered the Central Labor Institute in April 1967. </p>
        <p>The majority of the students were young men and women who were working and studying at the same time, and
            there were also a few active university students attending the school. </p>
        <p>The classrooms were full of enthusiasm, reflecting the social situation at the time, with the innovative
            Tokyo Governor Minobe in office and just before the university conflicts. The main reason I chose this
            institute was the low tuition fees. However, in the summer of my third year of high school, as if obsessed
            with something, I continued to binge-read in order to find hints for my way of life. I read the Russian
            Maxim Gorky's (1868-1936) "The Life of Klim Samgin." Gorky had been a source of great intellectual
            excitement for me. I was fascinated by the way in which the study of social relations had captured my
            attention. </p>
        <p>Samgin's life overlapped with mine. Samgin placed his life in a realm that had nothing to do with the Russian
            Revolution, either materially or spiritually. He was vacuous and narcissistic, drawing a line in the sand at
            historical events. He pretended to be a mindless revolutionary and saw himself as a victim of history. As I
            read on, I felt like I was being accused of concealing my own thoughts. </p>
        <p>I wanted to dispel the brand of illness that hung over me, preventing me from even living a normal life.</p>
        <p>-- Society and disease. I wouldn't even be certain of my own 'life' unless I broke free from this blockade. I
            wanted to study the social system as an academic subject. </p>
        <p>The Central Labor Institute was in Minato Ward, Tokyo, and it took about two hours to commute to the school.
            I took a bus from Tama Zenshoen in Higashimurayama City to Kiyose Station, then took the Seibu Ikebukuro
            Line and the Yamanote Line, getting off at Shibuya Station. Then I switched to a Toden train bound for
            Kanasugibashi and got off at Sannohashi, a commute that spanned Tokyo from east to west.</p>
        <p>Each day, the school day started at 7 p.m., and I had to leave Tama Zenshoen at 4:30 p.m. to reach school in
            time for the beginning of the day. </p>
        <p>At the time, my only income was a living allowance and a disability welfare pension. After covering tuition
            fees and transportation costs, I had about 400 yen left over. To save this money and buy books, I spent my
            weekends visiting second-hand bookshops in Kanda and managed to acquire books I wanted to read. </p>
        <p>Fortunately, because I was enrolled in a sanatorium, I had three meals and shelter. I may have been more
            fortunate than the nearly 400 students who were seated side by side in the classroom.</p>
        <p>At the time, my youngest sister, Chie, visited me at Tama Zenshoen. She was probably surprised to see how
            poor I was. </p>
        <p>“This is for you, Toshio. From your father.” </p>
        <p>On her way home, she handed me 20,000 yen. Although I knew the source of the money was clearly part of her
            salary, I had no choice but to accept the lie. It had been two weeks since I entered the school. </p>
        <p>I was greeted by three young men and women who approached my seat during recess. “Iha-san, you're from
            Okinawa, aren't you? We are from Ie Island. I am Kinnjo.” “I'm Taira.” “I'm Kaneshiro.”</p>
        <p>For a while after that, the conversation in the classroom was limited to this group of two women and one man
            from Ie Island. I rarely spoke to them. </p>
        <p>From our brief conversation, I learned that they were around 20 years old and had been sent by the 'Iejima
            Land Protection Association' (President: Shoko Ahagon), which had been opposing the confiscation of land by
            the US military. </p>
        <p>I had always chosen a seat in the front row, middle seat. This was because I always wanted to escape as much
            as possible from the gaze that was focused on my hands. Front row, middle seat, I only had to meet the gaze
            of the professor. </p>
        <p>I could name only four or five alumni, despite having attended the school almost continuously for two years
            with the exception of three days on sick leave. This showed how much I avoided contact with others at the
            time. </p>
        <p>I was afraid of the stares from those around me. </p>
        <p>In the city and on the train, I was pursued by piercing, cold eyes. My hands were always tucked away in my
            pockets. </p>
        <p>A characteristic feature of a person affected by leprosy is that, at one time or another, everyone is
            prepared for the end of their life as soon as the disease is diagnosed. This is not because they are
            convinced that their disease is incurable, nor because they despair of it as a deadly disease. The cause is
            the conclusion reached by the patient himself, who is overwhelmed by the social perception of leprosy. </p>
        <p>The life of convalescence, which is supposed to heal the disease and restore life, also gradually catches up
            with the sick person's own mind over time, and before long, they are reduced to believing that their illness
            is a special disease. </p>
        <p>The whispers of the 'specter', which the patient himself is supposed to deny with certainty, gradually
            prepare him to abandon humanity. Thus, the brand of 'leprosy' settles in the dark recesses of the mind. </p>
        <p>This brand will remain with them for the rest of their lives, even after they are cured, and they will not be
            able to escape it. For this reason, people with leprosy try to cope with their illness by keeping their
            history secret and by erasing certain periods of their lives from their history.</p>
        <p>Even the conversations among the people involved are meticulously kept secret, often using cryptic language
            in an all-out effort to conceal the past. For example, the term used to describe leprosy is 'the disease',
            and sanatoria are referred to as 'in' or 'inside'. </p>
        <p>It is never said, "I have leprosy. I have been cured after receiving treatment at a sanatorium.”</p>
        <p>The Leprosy Prevention Law, which was repealed in 1996, may have been the greatest crime of this law, but it
            may have also deprived the affected individuals and their families of the meaning of their life in this
            world by branding them down with “the feeling that they had a special disease." </p>
        <p>I was no exception either. </p>
        <p>Its shadow still sometimes shows up in my behavior. When I feel people's eyes on me, I unconsciously hide my
            hands. </p>
        <p>Tama Zenshoen is surrounded by a hedge of holly trees. Whenever I enter the sanatorium through this hedge, I
            always stop for a while. And then I let out a big breath. </p>
        <p>It was a sense of relief that we had finally returned to my own world. Yet, I continued to go to the
            institute because the allure of the lectures never let me go. I wanted to know the true nature of the
            'social system' that was overtaking me. Whatever it was, I wanted a clue. </p>
        <p>Each of the problems that have been hazy and unanswered until now is being cleared away. Every day in the
            classroom was a series of surprises. </p>
        <p>Four months had passed since the start of school. </p>
        <p>“Can I sit next to you?” </p>
        <p>Then, Yamaguchi, an officer of the student union, took a permanent seat to my left. </p>
        <p>“I'm Yamaguchi. Nice to meet you.” </p>
        <p>“I'm Iha.” </p>
        <p>“Iha? How do you write?" </p>
        <p>I wrote Iha in my notebook. </p>
        <p>“And you read it as Iha? That's unusual.” </p>
        <p>“I work in Shibuya, so I thought I could get to class before everyone else, but you're always first. Do you
            work near the institute?” </p>
        <p>“No, Higashimurayama. I'm not working now because of a slight physical injury.” </p>
        <p>“Higashimurayama? In the Tama Lake area?” </p>
        <p>------ If I am asked about this kind of deformed hand, I will answer in this way. I had already prepared the
            words in my head. </p>
        <p>“I can't wait eating until nine o'clock, so excuse me for a moment.” </p>
        <p>After saying so, Yamaguchi began pouring bread and milk into his extraordinarily large body. Then, he then
            began to looking through his textbooks.</p>
        <p></p>

    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>On that day, I arrived at Shibuya Station an hour earlier than usual to buy a commuter pass. </p>
        <p>"Mr. Iha, you're very early," the person who approached me was Professor Shigeo Hatada, who later ran for
            Governor of Tokyo and taught International Politics. </p>
        <p>"Hello," I said. "I was going to buy a commuter pass." </p>
        <p>"Have you finished?" </p>
        <p>"Yes, I have." </p>
        <p>"Okay. Would you like to have tea with me?" </p>
        <p>Nervously, I followed him across the overpass towards Tokyu Plaza. He took a seat by the window of the coffee
            shop and asked me if I would like a cup of coffee. </p>
        <p>Then he asked, "You are from Okinawa, aren’t you, Iha-san?" "Yes, I am. But I've been out of Okinawa for
            seven years now."</p>
        <p>"Remember the young pastor at the inauguration of High Commissioner Anger on November 2 last year? The
            'prayer' in front of Commissioner Arai was a stirring experience for all of us. The prayer was not just an
            appeal to the High Commissioner. It was a prayer for all Japanese on the mainland, including myself." </p>
        <p>I was happy. The professor was speaking of the prayer by Pastor Taira. </p>
        <p>"His name is Pastor Osamu Taira!" </p>
        <p>It was customary for pastors to pray at the inauguration ceremonies of successive High Commissioners, but a
            33-year-old local pastor gave what could be described as an unusual invocation.</p>
        <p>"As a result of the threat of war, Okinawa is cut off from its homeland. God, I strongly hope that peace will
            come to the world as soon as possible, that the new High Commissioner will be the last High Commissioner,
            and that Okinawa will return to its original normal state. May the new High Commissioner bow deeply before
            the dignity of the human rights of these citizens."</p>
        <p>Afterward, the conversation continued for some time. </p>
        <p>"Oh yes, Yamaguchi-kun was worried about you. 'No matter how much I talk to Iha-kun, he never seems to open
            his heart to me.' In the classroom, your eyes are always glazed over, so much so that it's a topic of
            conversation among the professors. The most important thing to remember is that being proactive is the best
            way to make the most out of your time." </p>
        <p>I was also very happy to hear the favor of my friend, but my hands were still under the table.</p>
        <p>"I'm going back to Kumamoto for the first time in a long time. Why don’t you come with me? It’s very rural."
        </p>
        <p>After the bell rang to start classes, Yamaguchi asked me. </p>
        <p>"Sorry, I have a few things to do," I replied. </p>
        <p>Yamaguchi stared at me. </p>
        <p>"Do you really have plans?" </p>
        <p>He asked in an unusually strong tone. I had been invited many times before. </p>
        <p>From student union meetings to invitations to go hiking, to his room... but my reply was always the same.
        </p>
        <p>"I have other plans." </p>
        <p>"Another time." </p>
        <p>Until now, this kind of conversation had lost its spark with a ‘Well, that's too bad,’ but today was
            different: </p>
        <p>"Tomorrow is Saturday, so it should be okay to be late today. Don't run away tonight!" I was dragged out of
            the classroom. </p>
        <p>The small restaurant 'Yoshimura' was in front of the San-no-hashi bus stop, down the hill from the school.
        </p>
        <p>"Ehh, Rasshiya! (welcome)," the clerk said. </p>
        <p>The restaurant was deserted, with only a few customers who seemed to be regulars at the counter. </p>
        <p>"This is Yamaguchi, whom I called earlier." ---- "The two of you, right?" </p>
        <p>I refused Yamaguchi's repeated offers of food, saying I didn't want any. </p>
        <p>"Then let’s just have beer. Excuse me, three beers and some edamame (green soybeans), please." </p>
        <p>Instead of ordering a full meal, we only ordered beer. </p>
        <p>"If you want anything else, just ask." </p>
        <p>I had been feeling anxious about the completely unpredictable turn of events for a few minutes now. </p>
        <p>We made a conventional toast. </p>
        <p>"Hey, I'm going to tell my story to you. I'm not asking you to talk about yourself in exchange for my story.
            You can just listen." </p>
        <p>Yamaguchi took off his glasses and sat down before opening his mouth. </p>
        <p>"In the second year of high school, I was a troublemaker and caused a lot of trouble for everyone around me.
            Before I knew it, I had been flattered and even became the leader of a group of juvenile delinquents. There
            was an agricultural high school in the next town over, and I was always getting into fights with them. I was
            acting tough at the time, so I thought, 'Today is the day I am going to fight the leader of the other group
            fighting us.' I went into the fight with a knife hidden in my hand. In truth, the knife was meant to be a
            threat, but it turned out that way. My opponent was seriously wounded, so I was sent to a reformatory for
            two years. That's the usual course, so I couldn't go back to that high school. After that, I went to Tokyo
            and finally graduated from the part-time high school.“ </p>
        <p>When he finished, Yamaguchi glared at me. </p>
        <p>"You might be annoyed, but I'm strangely curious about you!" </p>
        <p>Yamaguchi said and downed the beer left in his glass in one gulp. </p>
        <p>"So, for some reason, I can't stand looking at you..." </p>
        <p>I couldn't say anything. There was a pause for breath. </p>
        <p>"I don't know! But I can't stand it!" </p>
        <p>Yamaguchi's words hit me. I was suddenly beginning to think that he was the only one I could... </p>
        <p>"Thank you, Yamaguchi. Do you know about Hansen's disease?" Yamaguchi shook his head. "Usually, it's called
            leprosy. I'm a recovering patient of that disease!" </p>
        <p>He looked surprised. </p>
        <p>I was beginning to regret that I had not told him earlier. </p>
        <p>"Wait a minute... I had heard that there was a hospital for people with that disease in Nishigoushi Village,
            Kikuchi County, near my home..." </p>
        <p>"Yes, there is. There is a sanatorium there for people with the disease. My hand became like this because of
            the aftereffects of that disease."</p>
        <p>I fluttered my hands in front of my face. </p>
        <p>“Did the illness do that to you?” </p>
        <p>“Yes, but I've undergone several plastic surgeries and finally, this is the last one.” </p>
        <p>“But you're cured, aren't you?” </p>
        <p>“Yes, I'm cured.” </p>
        <p>Suddenly, Yamaguchi threw a hand towel at me. </p>
        <p>“You idiot! So it's even stranger, isn't it? In my case, I did that myself so I can't make any excuses. But
            is it your fault? I was sent to a juvenile detention center because of my own actions. That's why I'm so
            ashamed that I can't face the world. I can't atone for that crime even if I spend the rest of my life. But
            your illness has nothing to do with your humanity, does it? Come on, am I wrong?” </p>
        <p>Yamaguchi's loud voice echoed through the small room, and tears welled up in my eyes. </p>
        <p>Yamaguchi's words changed me in an instant. </p>
        <p>Since then, my hands have remained out of my pockets just as they are. </p>
        <p>Seven years later, while serving as a legislator in a regional city, Yamaguchi died in a traffic accident.

    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>Two young women came to visit me at Tama Zenshoen, saying they had heard about me from others. </p>
        <p>“We are Asayama and Kusamina, and we work at Akitsu Ryoikuen, an institution for children with severe mental
            and physical disabilities. There will be a screening of the film 'Children before Dawn' at Yasaka Elementary
            School tonight, so please come and see it.” </p>
        <p>“In fact, we are in trouble. We have so many unsold tickets.” </p>
        <p>“How much is it?” </p>
        <p>“Two hundred yen.” </p>
        <p>200 yen was a lot for me, but these girls were so enthusiastic that I decided to buy a ticket. </p>
        <p>“Okay, by the way, what kind of film is it?” </p>
        <p>The woman, who identified herself as Kusamina, blushed and hurriedly held out a leaflet. </p>
        <p>“More information can be found in this leaflet. Please read this.” </p>
        <p>“It starts at seven o'clock,” </p>
        <p>I read the leaflet which the woman handed me carefully. </p>
        <p>---Kazuo Itoga - Biwako Gakuen - Cerebral Palsy - Developmental Guarantee. </p>
        <p>All of these names and terms were new to me. </p>
        <p>---Every child has the right to develop. </p>
        <p>I was beginning to be drawn to Dr. Itoga's words for some reason. </p>
        <p>The smiles on the children's faces, distorted by their disabilities, the sweat dripping down the foreheads of
            the staff caring for the bedridden children. </p>
        <p>Why? Leprosy, which I had never been able to erase, gradually became a small part of my life. ----. </p>
        <p>“Everyone develops," these words made my body feel hot.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>“Mr. Iha, how did you like it?” </p>
        <p>As I walked out of the classroom after the film session, Ms. Asayama called out to me. </p>
        <p>“Thank you for inviting me to the film.” </p>
        <p>“I'm glad. I was feeling a bit sorry for asking you to do it.” </p>
        <p>“Iha-san, I'd like you to join us for the film review session at seven tomorrow night. The place is my room.”
        </p>
        <p>I gave a vague reply. </p>
        <p>“Wait a minute, please. I will write down the directions to my room," she said, smiling at me. </p>
        <p>“I'll wait for you, by all means…” </p>
        <!-- <p><草皆と名乗っていた娘も、ニコニコ笑いながら声を掛けてきた。></p> -->
        <p>That day, after seven o'clock, I still didn’t know what to do. That was the first time for me to go to
            someone else's house outside the sanatorium. </p>
        <p>When I finally left my room, it was 30 minutes after the appointed time. To get to the place indicated on the
            map, all I had to do was go out the back gate of Tama Zenshoen and take the straight road to Akitsu Station.
        </p>
        <p>I reached Daiichi Fujisou without getting lost. The sign indicated a room on the left end of the second
            floor. </p>
        <p>When I entered the room, I felt chilled. In a six-tatami-mat room, twelve or thirteen women were sitting in a
            small circle. </p>
        <p>For some reason, they were greeted with applause. </p>
        <p>“Everyone, let me introduce you. Here is an only prince: the main guest for today.” </p>
        <p>I was completely overcome by the unexpected situation. </p>
        <p>“I'm Iha. Nice to meet you."</p>
        <p>After the introduction, the interrupted discussion began again. I was just listening in silence to their
            discussion. </p>
        <p>--Are the girls from Akita Prefecture, who were featured in the newspaper, dedicated careers at a home for
            children with severe physical and mental disabilities: 'Obako Tenshi (angels)?' </p>
        <p>The girls, who seemed to be only a couple of years out of high school, were leaning forward and discussing as
            if they couldn't wait for the other girl to finish speaking. </p>
        <p>I just kept being overwhelmed. </p>
        <p>What is rehabilitation? What is support? What is child developmental security? </p>
        <p>The discussions taking place sounded fresh and new, something that had not been experienced before. </p>
        <p>Gradually, the discussions were getting into specific issues that were happening in the workplace. </p>
        <p>“Sayo, the way you talk to Mr. 00 is not right. You should stop using infantile language. Even if he is
            mentally handicapped, you should talk to him in a way that is appropriate for his age. The children's
            language is improper.” </p>
        <p>“Obuchi-san, you should not be involved only with 00. It is contrary to the treatment and education policy
            that we have decided on together.” </p>
        <p>They showed no mercy towards each other. The conversation became heated, and even the Akita dialect became
            mixed in, with the voices gradually becoming louder and louder. </p>
        <p>The woman who had introduced herself earlier as 'I am Nurse Nakamura' would occasionally raise her voice in
            warning. “You're speaking too loudly; speak in a small voice.” </p>
        <p>--- Is this woman the facilitator of the group?</p>
        <p>Watching from outside the circle, the position of each person in the group gradually becomes apparent. </p>
        <p>There are women who are so passionate about their work and their children. I even began to develop a certain
            respect for them. At first, they treated me like a polite guest, even interrupting the discussion, but as
            the discussion heated up, they seemed to forget about my presence, which somehow made me feel comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>I continued to go back and forth with the women's group at Akitsu Ryoikuen for a long time after that.
            Shigeko, whom I later remarried, was one of them. The days of contact with these women somehow opened my
            closed heart, before I knew it. </p>
        <p>I began to see 'society', which I had previously thought of as a distant world. The hearts that had been so
            damaged needed time for a 'soft landing'. The girls helped me prepare my heart to return to society again.

        <p>March 1969. The graduation ceremony of the Central Labor Academy was held. </p>
        <p>I thought I could be proud of my attendance rate, but to my surprise, I was informed by the secretary-general
            that I had been elected valedictorian for this term. I still believe that I was given this honor solely
            based on the "hard-working valedictorian" selection criteria. </p>
        <p>I can now shake the hand of Dean Makoto Hori without hesitation. </p>
        <p>“Congratulations. You did a great job.” </p>
        <p>“Thank you very much.” </p>
        <p>I had decided to put an end to my nearly twelve-year stay at the sanatorium on the occasion of my graduation.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, in February, I applied to leave the sanatorium. In an interview room in the administrative annex,
            I met with a Sato caseworker. </p>
        <p>“I'm sure you've thought this through, but you're about to do something very difficult.” </p>
        <p>‟Mr. Sato, I will tell the truth to anyone that I have been cured. Of course, I don't want to hide the fact
            that it was leprosy.” </p>
        <p>“That is reckless. Look, I have brought many cured people into the world. They have reintegrated into society
            without sequelae and with everything hidden. You still have the aftereffects of leprosy. That is clear for
            all to see.” </p>
        <p>“That's why I can't escape. I must live with leprosy.” </p>
        <p>“You cannot underestimate today's society, which stubbornly rejects people affected by leprosy. And you have
            such visible aftereffects. It's even more difficult.” </p>
        <p>The discussion between the caseworker and I went on and on. </p>
        <p>“I can see you're going to be ripped to shreds and torn to pieces.” </p>
        <p>“But it's the only way. My way of life is ----" </p>
        <p>Sato Caseworker reluctantly agreed. </p>
        <p>“Well, if you are so determined, we will do our best to support you.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="spacer"></p>
        <p>In the examination room, Director Ryoichi Yajima, Dr. Hazama, Dr. Hirako, Dr. Ohira, Dr. Narita, and the Sato
            caseworker were lined up around me, with my upper body stripped naked. </p>
        <p>Dr. Hirako gave a report on me. </p>
        <p>“The applicant has been medication-free with dapsone (DDS<sup id ="*1"><a href="#1">*1</a></sup>) for eight years now.
            All the histological specimens are also in good condition.” </p>
        <p>The director declared after a final palpation. </p>
        <p>“Then we unanimously approve Mr. Iha's withdrawal from the sanatorium.” </p>
        <p>The headmaster asked me a direct question. </p>
        <p>“Have you found a job?” </p>
        <p>“I'm going to work as a medical assistant at a hospital in Tachikawa, through the recommendation of Dr.
            Hazama.” </p>
        <p>“Well, I'm very glad to hear that, but it's the first time we've received an application for discharge with a
            limb like Iha-san's. That's the only thing I'm worried about.” </p>
        <p>“He's a hard worker.” </p>
        <p>Sato, the caseworker's answer could be taken to mean that he was only relying on my mental strength to deal
            with the fears expressed by the director. </p>
        <p>The anxious expressions did not disappear from all the doctors present. </p>
        <p>Dr. Hirako wrote a note in my medical record and called out to me: </p>
        <p>“Iha-san, hang in there. Whenever you can't do your best, you can always come back to us.” </p>
        <p>“Thank you. ...but I will never go through this gate here again!”</p>
        <p></p>

                In 1943, the American Faget announced that a derivative of the sulfonamide drug Promin was effective as
                a treatment for leprosy. In Japan, after the war, Morizo Ishidate, a former professor at the University
                of Tokyo, succeeded in synthesizing the drug. Promin was injected intravenously. Subsequently, Dapsone
                was developed as an oral drug, paving the way for outpatient treatment. Rifampicin was subsequently
                developed. Since 1983, multidrug combination therapy (DDS, B663, and rifampicin) has been the mainstay
                of treatment. With this combination therapy, leprosy loses its infectivity in a few days.</p>
