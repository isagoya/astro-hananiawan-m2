    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>In March 1969, the buds of the cherry trees were beginning to change color. </p>
        <p>“Iha, are you free tomorrow? I'm sorry to rush you, but I need your help to proofread the conference agenda.
            Will you go with me to the printing factory in Nakano Ward?” </p>
        <p>Hiroaki Yabe, General Secretary of the Tokyo Metropolitan Foster Care Workers' Union (now Secretary General
            of the National Study Group on Welfare Issues for the Elderly), approached me. I met him at a study meeting
            of the National Study Group on Disability Issues, and we have been close friends ever since. </p>
        <p>After the proofreading, Mr.Yabe guided me to visit the Tokyo Colony workshop. At the entrance of the
            two-story block-built factory, there were signs reading 'Tokyo Colony Corporate Headquarters' and
            'Secretariat of the National Association of Colonies'. </p>
        <p>I stopped in front of a discolored plaque.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <dl class="ms-4">
            <p class="fw-bold">Our Pledge.</p>
            <dt>(The Pioneer's Way)</dt>
            <dd>1. We are pioneers who are forging a path that has never been tested before with our own hands.</dd>
            <dt>(Joy of Work)</dt>
            <dd>2.Rather than seeking comfort and ease, we find our life's purpose in working diligently in the face of

        <p>"Mr. Yabe, what is this?" </p>
        <p>"Oh, this? It is the organizational philosophy of the National Association of Colonies, which has its secretariat here. It was formulated in 1949 after long discussions. The organizational philosophy consists of a preamble and this 'Our Pledge'</p>
        <p>“Could you wait a moment while I transcribe it?" </p>
        <p>On the train on the way home, I read the ‘Our Pledge’ again and again, transcribing it in my notebook. Every
            word conveyed the dreams and fighting spirit of human beings. </p>
        <p>“Mr. Yabe, what kind of place is Tokyo Colony?” </p>
        <p>“It is a social welfare facility <span id="*1">called ’ju-san'<sup><a href="#1">*1</a></sup></span> The word 'ju-san' means 'to create products.' It is the only welfare facility that engages in economic activities. At the time of its founding, society did not readily accept people recovering from tuberculosis who wanted to work in society, so they created their own workplaces and tried to become socially independent by acquiring skills and earning profits from actual work. Right now, they are focusing on people recovering from tuberculosis, but in two years, they plan to open a facility for the physically handicapped as well." </p>
        <p>“Everyone seems to be in good health.” </p>
        <p>“They look fine, but most of them are people recovering from tuberculosis and have low lung capacity. My sister has been working there since the founding days. They have been in business since 1949 and have finally been able to receive public subsidies, so they can live a little easier. But I hear it's tough."
        </p>
        <p>“Mr. Yabe, can you tell us more about the Tokyo Colony?” </p>
        <p>"In 1949, society did not yet have the conditions to accept sanatorium patients with tuberculosis. Convalescents at the National Nakano Sanatorium in Nakano Ward, Tokyo, began building facilities using carriages that the Japanese National Railways had sold after they were no longer in use. </p>
        <p>This was the start of the Tokyo Colony. In 1961, ten facilities that shared the same goals and ideals came together to form the National Association of Colonies (now 'Zenkoro', a member of twelve corporations) to address vocational issues for people with disabilities." </p>
        <p>“Mr. Yabe, I would like to see detailed information about the colonies.” </p>
        <p>“I'll ask my sister.” </p>
        <p>Two days later, I received a copy of the "National Colony Monthly." </p>
        <p>The first issue of the magazine was published on February 1, 1961, and my eyes were glued to the address by
            Chairman Minoru Nomura:</p>
        <p></p>
        <div class="ms-4">
            <p>"This association was born as an organization for nationwide communication and cooperation among those
                who are struggling with the difficulties of social rehabilitation, not only on their own but also for
                the sake of others suffering from the same illnesses. …… (omission)</p>
            <p>What is blocking the way? We all know that there are many problems, none of them small. We, of course,
                know this, as do bureaucrats, scholars, doctors, and social entrepreneurs. And although measures have
                been taken, albeit modest and crude, there are still countless people recovering from tuberculosis who
                are in trouble, and countless others who are burdened by the difficulties of life and fear a recurrence
                of the disease tomorrow. </p>
            <p>The problem is too big, too complicated, and too unmanageable. That is the voice of the general public.
                But that doesn't mean that people who cannot sit still, who feel the problem as their own thing, have no
                choice but to stand up. This is where two different approaches are born, one from the outside and the
                other from the inside. (later omission)“</p>
        </div>
        <p>Furthermore, in the "National Colony Monthly Report" No. 5 (August 25, 1961), Chairman Nomura shined a spotlight on the dream I had been searching for. </p>
        <div class="ms-4">
            <p>“In the forthcoming Tuberculosis Prevention Week at the end of October, we are working hard to organize a
                conference of the colonies for people recovering from tuberculosis scattered all over the country. </p>
            <p>We are but a few, and our strength is very small. Even if we add the facilities we are planning, we will
                not reach fifteen... Only 250-60 tuberculosis recoveries are involved in the colony.</p>
            <p>In the eyes of politicians and businessmen, this is not worth the buzz of a single bee. The word
                'excited' may be a common word only for us.</p>
            <p>However, a preparatory meeting was held at the end of July last year, and a total of ten facilities
                gathered from as far away as Yamagata, Fukuoka, Kumamoto, Yamaguchi, Nagano, and Kanagawa. </p>
            <p>At the meeting, I said to the participants, ‘This is probably the first of its kind in the world, let
                alone Japan’. </p>
            <p>The value doesn't come from the fact that it's an unusual project. All of this was initiated by people determined to do it by any means. Because it was born before the law was enacted, the momentum for the enactment of the law is increasing. </p>
            <p>Everything necessary for society is initiated by the private sector. It is the general rule of business.
            </p>
            <p>I have high hopes. I have high hopes. We have no political, ideological or social background. It's just a battle with nothing.
            </p>
            <p>So I expect.</p>
            <p>I wonder if Tokugawa Ieyasu (the first Shogun of the Edo period) felt the same way when he considered
                which side to take in the battle of the stones on the riverbank. People are strong when they are weak,
                and they can live most purely when they are few. (later omission)"</p>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>Even if one examines these statements in relation to the social welfare policies of the time, it is still
            surprising how prescient they were at that time. The Council on Employment of the Physically Disabled
            finally reported in May of that year on "Measures to Promote Employment of the Severely Physically Disabled,
            Persons Cured of Tuberculosis, and Mentally Feeble Persons." </p>
        <p>Chairman Nomura's assertion sounded like a voice from heaven. I felt like an electric current was running
            through my body. </p>
        <p>...I understand. Some people have already begun to take action. While there are distinctions between tuberculosis and leprosy, I don't have to carry on the struggle by myself. This Tokyo Colony is precisely what I had been searching for!</p>
        <div class="notes">
        <p id="1"><sup><a href="#*1">*1</a></sup> Social welfare facilities, 'ju-san', provide necessary vocational training or a

    <h2 id="blue-partitioning-screen">Blue Partitioning Screen</h2>
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>On March 28th, I visited the Tokyo Colony. </p>
        <p>I was taken to an office about eight tatami mats in size, separated by a partition covered with blue cloth.
            In the room to my left, two women were working at desks. In the back room, a sofa with springs protruding
            from the ends was set in front of the desk. </p>
        <p>"My name is Iha. I am here to discuss my interest in working at Tokyo Colony. How can I work here?" </p>
        <p>The man, who said he was a caseworker, looked surprised by my outburst. </p>
        <p>"Where do you live?" </p>
        <p>"I am currently at Tama Zenshoen in Higashimurayama City. I have been given permission to leave the facility,
            so I can leave anytime I want." </p>
        <p>"Tama Zenshoen? You mean the one for Hansen's Disease? You had the disease?" </p>
        <p>"Yes, I did. I am completely cured. I have just received permission to leave." </p>
        <p>"Did you consult the welfare office?" </p>
        <p>"No." </p>
        <p>"No, you can't do that. You need a referral from the welfare office. You can't come directly here." </p>
        <p>"I'm sorry. I was recommended by Mr. Yabe." </p>
        <p>"Mr. Yabe, who works here?" </p>
        <p>"No, he's the brother of the person who works here." </p>
        <p>"I see. This is a facility mainly used by people recovering from tuberculosis. Therefore, people like you who
            are recovering from leprosy cannot be accepted here. Do you know what kind of facility this is?" </p>
        <p>"Yes, I heard that I could learn about work opportunities here." </p>
        <p>"You know, each person has their own aptitude when it comes to learning techniques. Do you know what they do
            here?" </p>
        <p>"Yes, I do. I heard that you are in the printing business. I like to read books." </p>
        <p>"Your love of books is not directly related to your job. Besides, even if you are admitted here, you would
            receive only a small training allowance during the technical training period." </p>
        <p>"No problem." </p>
        <p>"What are your plans after you leave Tama Zenshoen?" </p>
        <p>"Um, don't you have a dormitory here?" </p>
        <p>"There is, but there are no vacancies at the moment." </p>
        <p>The eyes that peered at me over the tops of his glasses gave a look of rejection. </p>
        <p>"I'm sure you have a very severe hand disability," he said. "With your hand functions, you can't work here."
        </p>
        <p>"I will do whatever you want. Could you please do something about it?" </p>
        <p>"This colony only accepts people who can become independent technicians following training." </p>
        <p>"I'll do my best. Could you please help me?" </p>
        <p>"I'm very eager, but I'm afraid it's impossible at the Tokyo Colony. We are planning to open a facility for
            the handicapped in two years, so please come back then. Well then, I have another appointment from now on.
            Thank you for your effort today, even though you have come a long way. Good luck." </p>
        <p>The interview was clearly a failure. </p>
        <p>"Thank you."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>---As I thought, it was impossible... </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>I was overcome with an indescribable feeling of emptiness. I left the office and headed for Ekoda Station on
            the Seibu Ikebukuro Line. About 100 meters away, I heard a voice calling me from behind. </p>
        <p>"Mr. Iha, wait a moment." </p>
        <p>I turned around to see a petite middle-aged woman chasing after me, out of breath. When she caught up with
            me, the woman was breathing heavily, leaning on her shoulder for a while. </p>
        <p>"I heard it all from behind the partition. I'm sorry. We treated you so badly. Don't be disappointed.
            Unfortunately, Director Shirabe is out of town today... I'll make sure you get to see him there, so please
            don't be discouraged, okay?" </p>
        <p>The woman had tears in her eyes. </p>
        <p>"Can I call you?" </p>
        <p>"Yes, you can. Please call Tama Zenshoen." </p>
        <p>"Tell me the number, and I'll make sure we call you back." "Yes, please."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>On March 25, 1995, I was asked to give a eulogy at the "Memorial Gathering for Yoshie Shirabe," which
            recounted the scene of our encounter at that time.</p>
        <p>I asked her, "Auntie, are you running as fast as you can in heaven? Don’t you get short of breath when you
            run? Are you okay with a lung capacity of 680 cc and one lung? Are you not in pain anymore? Good for you.
        </p>
        <p>Twenty-six years ago, the colony was poor, and the office was poorly furnished, with only a partition between
            the rooms. So, the entirety of my interview with a caseworker could be overheard by you in the next room. If
            the building had been made of concrete as it is now and the reception room had been partitioned off into
            separate rooms, our conversation during the interview would not have reached your ears as it did at that
            time. And if you had not come after me then... I would not be where I am today."</p>

    <h2 id="workplace-debate">Workplace Discussion</h2>
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>It was shortly after I returned to Zenshoen from the Tokyo Colony that day. The announcement in the
            sanatorium called out to me. </p>
        <p>“Mr. Iha. Mr. Toshio Iha. There is a call from outside the sanatorium. Please pick up the nearby telephone.
            Mr. Iha, you have an outside call.” </p>
        <p>I rushed to the telephone in the sanatorium's office building. </p>
        <p>“Hello, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. This is Iha..." </p>
        <p>“Hello, is this Mr. Iha? I am Shirabe from the Tokyo Colony. Can you come to the colony tomorrow at 10:00
            a.m.?” </p>
        <p>“Yes! Yes, I can. I will be there at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.” </p>
        <p>I visited the colony again. </p>
        <p>“Sorry for yesterday. The caseworker didn't mean any harm. Please forgive him.” </p>
        <p>As he said this, Kazuoki Shirabe reached out his hand and shook mine. </p>
        <p>“Good morning. Welcome." </p>
        <p>The woman who had accompanied me yesterday offered me tea with a smile. </p>
        <p>“She is my wife.” </p>
        <p>Oh, she was the wife of the executive director... </p>
        <p>“Thank you for yesterday." </p>
        <p>I quickly stood up from my seat and bowed. </p>
        <p>“Good for you." </p>
        <p>“Yes…!” </p>
        <p>“So, I'll get right to it. What kind of work do you want to do?” </p>
        <p>“I've never worked before, so I have no idea what kind of work I'm suited for. I'm willing to do any job if
            you determine that I'm the right person for the job." </p>
        <p>“Let me see your hands. Hold my hand. Ah, it's quite strong. Please write your name and address on this
            paper.” </p>
        <p>I wrote down my name and address on the paper as indicated. </p>
        <pre>
        National Sanatorium Tama Zenshoen,
        4-1-1 Aobacho, Higashimurayama-city, Tokyo
        Toshio Iha
        </pre>
        <p>“You write so skillfully. Your handwriting is better than mine.” </p>
        <p>The executive director picked up the receiver and dialed the phone. </p>
        <p>“Ms. Mori? It's me. Can you come to my office for a moment?” </p>
        <p>Soon after, a tall woman entered the office, saying, "Excuse me." </p>
        <p>“Let me introduce you. This young man is Mr. Iha.” </p>
        <p>“I'm Mori, the head of the typing section.” </p>
        <p>She sat down next to me. </p>
        <p>“Is there a typewriter available?” </p>
        <p>“One typewriter is available, but..." </p>
        <p>“Oh, yes. This young man is Mr. Iha. Ms. Mori, how do you like his typing with his hands?” </p>
        <p>“Let me see your hand.” </p>
        <p>Ms. Mori pulled my hand close and tested the function of my fingers. </p>
        <p>"Bend your wrist down, yes, yes, now grip my index finger."</p>
        <p>“It's stronger than it looks. As long as you still have this much functionality, you should be fine.” </p>
        <p>“Thank you very much, and I will call you later. Mr. Iha, I understand you claim to be a leprosy survivor?” </p>
        <p>“Yes, I would like to work without hiding the fact that I am a person affected by leprosy.” </p>
        <p>“I have had tuberculosis for a long time, so I think I have some medical knowledge. When I visited the
            Ministry of Health and Welfare the other day, they had mobilized the guards to protect the building in
            preparation for a petition by leprosy patients. I came across an official in charge of the matter who
            ordered them not to take even one step inside the ministry. I was furious that the supervising government
            agency had to be like this, but this kind of nonsense must be changed as soon as possible..." </p>
        <p>“Yes.” </p>
        <p>“Mr. Iha, would you like to try your luck at our company?” </p>
        <p>“I will do my best.” </p>
        <p>“However, I believe that the 47 people who work at the colony have the same perception of leprosy as the rest
            of society. Since we are accepting you, we will try to have a thorough workplace discussion with all of
            them. It will take some time, but until then, can you wait?” </p>
        <p>“I will.” </p>
        <p>“We are about to be tested. I will do my best, and I want you to do the same." </p>
        <p>With these words, the executive director again firmly grasped both of my hands.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>I returned to the sanatorium and immediately went to see Mr. Sato, the caseworker. </p>
        <p>‟I am so sorry, Mr. Sato, but can you refuse the hospital clerical work job that you were introduced to me by Mr. Hazama? I'm going to work at a place called Tokyo Colony. I am terribly sorry.” </p>
        <p>“What happened suddenly? The hospital has even prepared a place for you to stay, starting next Monday.”</p>
        <p>“I'm sorry always making selfish requests." </p>
        <p>"Mr. Iha, you know that the vocational facility doesn't pay you anything like a salary... What are you going to do for the rest of your life? You will have to receive welfare for a while. Are you okay with that?” </p>
        <p>I had no choice but to explain my own thoughts. Mr. Sato listened with an occasional sigh. </p>
        <p>“I understand. Then your will is unwavering.” </p>
        <p>“Yes.” </p>
        <p>“Anyway, this is unprecedented, even for me. I have been a caseworker for a long time, and it is unthinkable
            for a leprosy survivor to go out into society without hiding your clinical history. I was just on
            the phone with Mr. Shirabe from Tokyo Colony. He has requested that the doctor and I be present at next
            week's workplace meeting. He wanted our professional advice." </p>
        <p>"I see, I'm sorry."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>In the end, I was forced to wait two months for admission to the Tokyo Colony. During that time, three
            thorough workplace discussions were held at the colony. </p>
        <p>At first, most of the employees' reactions were confusion because they had never heard of leprosy and anxiety
            about my spreading the disease. Through repeated workplace discussions, the awareness of many gradually
            changed. Unfortunately, however, two of the key members of the operation left the workplace as a result of
            this incident. </p>
        <p>-The loss of these two key personnel was a major blow to the business, but Tokyo Colony could not compromise on its philosophy. </p>
        <p>Executive Director Shirabe made a final decision. </p>
        <p>But there was still one issue that remained until the very end: That was who I would room with in the
            dormitory. </p>
        <p>The executive director was also aware of the possibility that I might not be able to get anyone to agree to this. At that time, he was even prepared to have me live with him at home. However, this concern was put to rest when Hideo Takahashi, who suffers from cerebral palsy, said, </p>
        <p>“I am fine with him in my room. I believe in medicine and science!”</p>

    <h2 id="the-bottom-of-the-bowl">The Bottom of the Bowl</h2>
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>The date of my arrival at the Tokyo Colony was June 2, 1969. </p>
        <p>I was assigned to the typing department. </p>
        <p>After about a month, I had finally gotten used to the workplace and could afford to look at my surroundings
            calmly. </p>
        <p>Dormitory life had a distant atmosphere that was different from that of the daytime workplace. I could sense
            a strange atmosphere that I did not know what was causing it.</p>
        <p>I finished my dinner as usual in the cafeteria and cleaned up myself. Then, the lunch lady slipped and dropped
            the lacquer bowl, I had just finished using ,from the washing area and it fell to the floor. The bowl rolled to my feet and was turned
            upside down. </p>
        <p>--What is that? </p>
        <p>There was a '〇' mark on the bottom of the bowl. The woman hurriedly picked up the dish from the floor,
            wrapped it in her apron, and hid it. </p>
        <p>--What in the world was that '〇' mark? Why was she in such a panic?</p>
        <p>The next day at breakfast, I casually lifted the dishes on the table in front of me to check. As I expected,
            all the dishes were marked with '〇' on their bases. It was the same as yesterday.</p>
        <p>I looked at the bottom of the dishes while helping Hideo Takahashi, who was sitting next to me, to prepare
            the meal. There was nothing on the bottom of the dishes. </p>
        <p>--I see. I wondered if the dishes I use are clearly differentiated from the others.</p>
        <p>Come to think of it, the use of the men's bath was also strange. When I paid close attention, I found that
            only four people were using the bath: Haruo Takahashi, the head of the printing plate-making section, and Hideo Takahashi, Saburo Kusunoki, a photo typesetter operator, and me.</p>
        <p>The other eight went out of their way to go to a nearby public bath called 'Manninburo,' saying, 'I want to
            take a bath before going to bed.' That was, after all, avoiding taking a bath with me. </p>
        <p>…It's hard...I suddenly felt depressed."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>A few days later, I was summoned to the director's office. </p>
        <p>There, with Executive Director Sirabe in the center, were Koichi Iwasaki and Mitsue Umemoto. The two had just
            graduated from Nihon Fukushi University this spring and had just started working at the colony. </p>
        <p>Mr. Iwasaki began to speak. </p>
        <p>“Before you entered the colony, you declared that you would never run away from leprosy. I was even moved to
            hear that, so I was going to do all I could to support you. But once you entered the facility, did you
            abandon your belief already?” </p>
        <p>Ms. Umemoto's face was flushed. </p>
        <p>“I think you are pathetic."</p>
        <p>“How can you be so calm? Why aren't you angry?” </p>
        <p>“Do you know that your dishes are separated and sterilized by boiling? We talked about it so many times, it's
            pathetic!” </p>
        <p>“Besides, I heard that many of your dorm mates don't even bathe together. You're turning a blind eye to it.
            It's cowardly.”</p>
        <p>“Sir, Everyone's actions at Tokyo Colony are too terrible!” </p>
        <p>The director looked puzzled. </p>
        <p>“I didn't know that was going on.” </p>
        <p>I hesitated to reply, unable to gather my thoughts on the exchange between the three of them. </p>
        <p>“The executive director should immediately gather all the employees and give them a warning!” </p>
        <p>“Yes," he said. “I agree. We should have another thorough workplace discussion!” </p>
        <p>Their proposal was taking a surprising turn. But contrary to their enthusiasm, I was beginning to think that
            something was wrong with the way they were handling the situation. </p>
        <p>“Wait a minute," I said. “I knew all about it. But please don't let the executive director warn them. People
            are confused now. I want to trust them more. I want to believe in everyone more. I think everyone is
            struggling with the old consciousness..." </p>
        <p>From within me, something like conviction began to well up. </p>
        <p>“The executive director's warning is based on the orders and logic of the organization's top management, so
            it certainly exerts a certain coercive force. But in that way, it will only have the effect of binding them
            to their emotional world. Prejudice is something that can only be overcome when emotions rise to the level
            of recognition. I think it will change when people trust me at work and in my dormitory life. I think I am
            not trying hard enough yet... As I am now, I am proof that I am not yet accepted as a member of the
            fellowship. I would like to trust my fellow colony members more. I think there is still not enough time for
            me and for everyone else. I am sure..." </p>
        <p>Mr. Iwasaki and Ms.Umemoto looked at each other, as if my comment was completely unexpected. Executive
            Director Sirabe thought for a while and then opened his mouth. </p>
        <p>“Well, let's see how it goes for a while this time, just as Iha-kun suggested. It's only been a month and a
            half since he joined us. Let's believe that everyone is just getting ready to take off the old robe. If
            things don't change, then we'll figure something out.”</p>
        <p>There was no need to think of anything else. After about four months, everything was behaving naturally. Of
            course, the '0' marks on the dishes disappeared, and everyone returned to the baths.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, six young men recovered from leprosy were employed at the colony one after the other. This was
            facilitated by the caseworker I first met at the colony."</p>

    <h2 id="the-form-of-human">The Form of Human</h2>
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>The Tokyo Colony gradually expanded its facilities in response to the welfare administration policies of the
            Tokyo Metropolitan Government under Minobe's leadership.</p>
        <p>In 1972, the Tokyo Colony took on the management of the Tokyo Metropolitan Katsushika Welfare Factory,
            Japan's first welfare factory for the physically handicapped. The Colony Higashimurayama Printing Plant was
            established in 1974, followed by the management of the Ota Welfare Factory in Tokyo in 1975. In 1981, the
            management of the Tokyo Metropolitan Hachioji Independence Home was entrusted to the colony. The
            establishment of the TOKOLO Information Processing Center followed in 1982, leading to a growth in the
            workforce to over 800 employees.</p>
        <p>In 1972, I was appointed as the manager of the newly established editorial section. In 1973, I became the
            plant manager of the Nakano Plant. In 1983, I assumed the role of manager at the Higashimurayama Printing
            Plant, and in 1988, I became the manager of the Colony Printing Plant. Since 1993, I have served as the
            Executive Director of the Tokyo Colony and Zenkoro Social Welfare Corporation.At the same time, I was also
            assigned an official role in the National Council of Social Welfare and the Tokyo Metropolitan Council of
            Social Welfare. </p>
        <p>The daily life in the "welfare field" led me to a certain point of confusion. One aspect of this was
            recognizing the limits of my own abilities as a welfare business manager. I was beginning to realize that my
            passion was fading, and I became convinced that I had reached the end of my career as a manager. </p>
        <p>Another significant occasion was the debate that began in 1994 regarding the abolition of the "Leprosy
            Prevention Law" among the concerned parties. I had been worried about the future of this debate, and as I
            had anticipated, it concluded with the "total zange (repentance) theory," in which no one took
            responsibility. </p>
        <p>I was motivated by the belief that I had one final task left to complete: to write about the human sorrows
            that are buried and sealed away. </p>
        <p>For me, this was a choice I made after careful consideration, but I believe it was perceived as a sudden
            indication of resignation by those involved. </p>
        <p>I resigned from the Tokyo Colony Social Welfare Corporation in August 1995. </p>
        <p>The twenty-six years since I left the sanatorium had passed like a whirlwind, but those years in the field of
            welfare constituted my very life.　</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>Mr. Minoru Nomura, who had a spiritual influence on me during my tenure, passed away in March 1996. He was 95
            years old. He had served as the president of the Tokyo Medical Caseworkers Association and chairman of the
            Japan Christian Overseas Medical Cooperation Association. I was related to him, as he was the chairman of
            the Zenkoro Incorporated Association and president of the Tokyo Colony Social Welfare Corporation. </p>
        <p>He not only translated Dr. Albert Schweitzer's book, "Between Water and Wilderness," and introduced it to
            Japan, but also traveled directly to Africa to assist Dr. Schweitzer's work. He was a man of principles and
            action.</p>
        <p>During his tenure as the director of Tokyo White Cross Hospital, he refused to sacrifice his "medical
            conscience" for "medical arithmetic" and finally left the hospital, saying, "I was defeated by money,"
            because "pursuing profit as a hospital manager is not the way of medicine." </p>
        <p>This attitude remained consistent throughout his life, even in the world of social welfare. </p>
        <p>At first glance, he may appear to be a mild-mannered man, but when discussing politics and society, he spoke
            passionately and was harsh towards people. He was a man who resisted all forms of power, was not influenced
            by the government, and was someone who approached things at the same eye level as the general public. </p>
        <p>His intensity was unwavering to me, even during my tenure as the director of the printing plant and executive
            director of Tokyo Colony Zenkoro. Even unconsciously, I repeatedly used the words "organization" and
            "management," but the president's words had the sharpness of a needle. </p>
        <p>“When did management begin to be used by a few people to control many people, as if they were dealing with
            goods? Am I right in understanding 'management' as a role in ensuring freedom and equality in human
            relations and human emotions? I have always worried that organizations kill people, though..." </p>
        <p>During my time as the director of the Colony Higashimurayama Printing Plant, the following incident occurred.
        </p>
        <p>"Mr. Chairman, you visit the plant once a month, but it would be a waste if you only talked with me, the
            plant director. Why don't you plan an opportunity to talk directly with your employees?” </p>
        <p>He immediately acted on my request. However, he set a condition for the meeting regarding ‘the number of
            people whose voices can be heard by each other.’ </p>
        <p>The meeting continued for about a year, and he later wrote about his impressions of the meeting in the Tokyo
            Colony's public relations magazine.</p>
        <p></p>
        <div class="ms-4">
        <p>“In April, a plan was launched to hold monthly meetings with about ten people from each department at a
            certain factory. I can't even remember their last names because of the aging process, and I can't see their
            faces.  The director of the factory thought that since we are all human beings, we could talk freely, so he set up a place for discussion. </p>
        <p>However, although I have often said that discussions are necessary, I have truly felt the difficulty of this.
            Even if you want to say something without hesitation, there is usually a sense of distance, making it hard
            to break the ice as in a well-wishers' meeting. This would not be due to the small number of tea cakes
            (omitted). </p>
        <p>Do not place too high expectations on a discussion that has just begun. It takes time to get used to the idea
            of having ten members gather once a month. And even if you can speak "without restraint," you can't express
            the whole picture. Nevertheless, it is better than not doing it at all, and I would like to continue it for
            a long time.” </p>
            </div>
        <p>I was giving a regular management report to the chairman of the board. </p>
        <p>"Mr. Iha, what is the recent situation regarding the admission of people with disabilities?” </p>
        <p>“The number of people with disabilities who come to the colony's door these days is increasing, and they are
            generally older and more severely handicapped. The number of people who can adapt to the printing business
            is gradually decreasing.”</p>
        <p>The chairman's expression changed instantly. </p>
        <p>“Mr. Iha, since when do we select people with disabilities for the business? Isn't it the other way around?
            People with disabilities choose Tokyo Colony. If they are found not to be able to perform the job after just
            one interview and the colony is closed to them, they will never get another chance... Isn't competence
            something that can only be discovered over time? If we eliminate them at the interview stage, where can they
            go?” </p>
        <p>It was a reprimand that felt like a bucket of cold water being poured. </p>
        <p>Come to think of it, it was the same when I was interviewed for admission to the colony. </p>
        <p>If I had been rejected at that time as "not suitable," I would not be where I am today. Before I knew it, I
            was trying to forget even my own past with the arrogant viewpoint that I could only stand on the "management
            side." </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>Over the past 26 years, I have had many encounters, but the people I recall are inevitably mainly people with
            disabilities. In particular, the encounters that reminded me of my own inadequacies have become my great
            regret.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>"Mr. H has been absent without notice for three days again. When we visited his room, there were signs that he was inside, but he did not open the door. The director is always too lenient with them, so H hasn’t changed at all!”</p>
        <p>Caseworker Sawano rushed into the director's office in the morning. The disturbances involving H had already
            been repeated many times. </p>
        <p>Even after taking a month or so off, he still turned up at the office and even showed up at the director's
            office to talk to me.</p>
        <p>"How are you, Mr. Director? I will work hard from now on.”</p>
        <p>As if nothing had happened since then, he began to work hard for several months. He had entered the colony
            after graduating from a school for the disabled, and it had been 12 years since then. In the hope that it
            would be a smooth transition, we made him move from the colony dormitory to a welfare flat in Nakano Ward to
            challenge him to lead an independent social life. </p>
        <p>He cried when he lost love, drank when he said he had failed at work, lamented that he could not see a future
            for himself, and locked himself in his room - the subject of institutional case conferences each time.</p>
        <p>“He was not ready for life outside the dorms. He needed constant restraint."</p>
        <p>“It lowers morale in the workplace. We couldn't count on him to do his job."</p>
        <p>The discussions at the case conference went on and on in circles. </p>
        <p>I had no choice but to yield to the executives.</p>
        <p>“He had been restrained at work more than enough,     he'll surely come to work, so let's give him some time.”
        </p>
        <p>H was handicapped by cerebral palsy and had a fair complexion and handsome features. Everyone called him
            "Tamasaburo" (the Kabuki actor).</p>
        <p>"Come on, boss, come hang out with me. I'll buy you a drink today."</p>
        <p>We sometimes drank together, but never once did he open his wallet. In the end, he was always drunk, hugging
            me and crying loudly.</p>
        <p>“It was a mistake to have been born into this world. Do you know how I feel now that there is no way out?”
        </p>
        <p>I could not respond to him with the usual words like "Hang in there."</p>
        <p>“I'm going into business with a friend. I'll succeed and donate to the colony."</p>
        <p>Even after he announced he was quitting and disappeared, he reappeared at the welfare office and started
            going to the colony again. He repeated this three times.</p>
        <p>“I will search for another way of life.”</p>
        <p>A few years later, he unilaterally left the colony, declaring to the welfare office.</p>
        <p>“Hello, I am H. I am currently in a hospital in rural Akita. Please let me work again when I get out of the
            hospital. The colony is the most suitable place for me. I will work diligently this time." </p>
        <p>However, a month later, news of H's death arrived from his family. Another beloved disabled person, long lost
            to human life, has passed away.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mt-5"></p>
        <p>The head of the production department had lost his composure. </p>
        <p>He said, "The floppies have been doused with soft drinks, and the data on the storage shelves may have been
            erased. We have been checking since this morning, and so far, we have found that 27 floppies are damaged. I
            think this is clearly a deliberate accident.”</p>
        <p>Three days later, N., was taken by the production manager and the section manager in charge to visit the director's office. </p>
        <p>“N came forward himself. He said he is the one who destroyed the floppy data last year.”</p>
        <p>The manufacturer's laboratory was mobilized to investigate the cause of the accident involving 100 floppy
            disks a year ago, but the report stated that the data had been erased due to an external magnetic force. We
            had mobilized all the operators and finally got it re-entered.... </p>
        <p>It never occurred to me that it could have been an intentional accident.</p>
        <p>"I did it. I'm sorry,” </p>
        <p>N bowed his head, his eyes unfocused. </p>
        <p>“Is it true?” </p>
        <p>I still couldn't believe it. </p>
        <p>“Yes.” </p>
        <p>“I'd like to talk to N alone. Would the manager and the section chief please leave the room for a while?" I
            said. </p>
        <p>N sat in front of me, wearing glasses that had slipped down, and his eyes were slurred. </p>
        <p>“How old are you now, N?” </p>
        <p>“…Tirty-five…”</p>
        <p>“How long have you been in the colony?” </p>
        <p>“Nineteen years.”</p>
        <p>“You were just a boy when you came here. But now it has been that long. Do you remember? ...You told me that
            you had never seen a striptease and asked me to do you a favor with a serious face. I had a hard time when
            everyone found out the next day... The women in the office accused me of being 'disgusting and
            disillusioning,' and it took me a while to regain their trust."</p>
        <p>N's mouth relaxed a little. His disability was cerebral palsy, and his speech was difficult to understand
            unless one was very familiar with it. </p>
        <p>“Why did you do such a stupid thing?”</p>
        <p>He did not answer. </p>
        <p>“How did you erase the data on the floppy disk?” </p>
        <p>Finally, he began to speak. </p>
        <p>“During my training, we were taught that floppy data is sensitive to magnetism. So... before, I tried using a
            magnet. This time... Not with a magnet, I sprinkled leftover canned coffee…” </p>
        <p>“I see. But why, N? You repeated it twice... Remember last time, it took your colleagues all night and days
            to restore the data. You must have been involved, N. Think about it... You denied your fellow handicapped
            workers their due. Am I right? And you were part of the data restoration process yourself. That's the most
            pathetic thing of all. Are you denying your own labor too?" </p>
        <p>My voice grew higher. I looked at N's rounded, smaller shoulders and saw myself overlapping him.</p>
        <p>“Director... I'll tell you. I got drunk and came back to the dormitory late... I felt bad for my roommates if
            I went back to my room, so I decided to have a cup of coffee to sober up, and I went into the factory. I was
            drinking coffee at my desk. I was just, you know, drinking coffee... And then the floppies on the shelf in
            the storage room laughed at me! ...'You're not as good as everyone else. You're the worst of the worst!'
            ...That's right. I try my hardest, but it's no use. I can't do a fraction of the work everyone else does.
            Those floppies knew that. The shelf was full of them. That's why..."</p>
        <p>N was ordered to leave the facility according to work rules. </p>
        <p>One year later, N wrote to us. </p>
        <p>“I am now working for a local workshop. I don't feel like I am working here. Can’t I work at the
            colony anymore?” </p>
        <p>I proposed at the department heads' meeting that N be readmitted to the colony. A heated debate ensued, but
            in the end, the majority opinion was that it was "premature," and N's wish was not granted. </p>
        <p>Six months later, his family informed me of his "debilitating death due to alcoholism." </p>

        <p>"Sir, is it possible to have a marriage without sex?” </p>
        <p>Y was sobbing in her wheelchair.</p>
        <p>She said, "When we get married, he wants to have children. I'm not sure I can do it with my body.” </p>
        <p>“I remember that you are from the National Rehabilitation Center for the Disabled. Who is your doctor? I
            think you should see him. I'm sure he will be able to help you if you visit him together.” </p>
        <p>“I'm afraid. If he says no... Besides, he happily informed me that he had already informed his family that he
            would marry me. That's all the more reason... I know it's only natural since he's in perfect shape... But
            every time we travel together, I am on the run. I don't want him to see this deformed body. I don't like
            it..."</p>
        <p>She was diagnosed with infantile paralysis before the age of two, and her spine was bent and stunted from the
            waist down. </p>
        <p>After completing training at the National Rehabilitation Center for the Disabled, she was unable to transfer
            from a wheelchair to a bed and a western-style toilet at her first interview for admission to the colony,
            and had to give up. After three years of strengthening her physical strength at home, she was finally able
            to enter the colony after another attempt. </p>
        <p>“My mother always said to me, from the time I was in junior high school, 'You mustn't fall in love with
            people because in the end, you will only suffer.' Is that still true? But I...” </p>
        <p>I just waited for her to stop crying. </p>
        <p>“Y, do you really like 0?” </p>
        <p>“I do.” </p>
        <p>“Do you like everything about him?” </p>
        <p>“Yes.” </p>
        <p>“I'm sure he does too. I think he likes you completely, including your curved body.” </p>
        <p>“But I'm afraid that when he sees my body, it's all over... I...” </p>
        <p>“If you and he are going to ruin your relationship because of that, I'd rather have it ruined as soon as
            possible.” </p>
        <p>I said it in a blunt way. At these words, Y bit her lip, wiped away her
            tears, and left the reception room. </p>
        <p>It was the day before the summer holiday that year. The lunch break in the factory was livelier than usual.
            In the middle of it all, Y approached me. </p>
        <p>“I am going back to the countryside in Akita with him.”</p>
        <p>It was 7:30 am after the summer break. The duty worker at the factory called me at home. </p>
        <p>“Ms. Y has been waiting since before seven o'clock to find out what time you would be coming to work.” </p>
        <p>“What did she say it was about?” </p>
        <p>"I keep asking her about it, but she doesn't answer me. 'I'm waiting for the manager to come out.' she has been waiting for you a long time." </p>
        <p>I rushed to work to see what was going on. In front of the director's office, she had a big smile on her
            face. </p>
        <p>Then she said shyly. “Warden, we were fine...” </p>
        <p>Everything made sense. “Well, that's good. Your father will say ‘Congratulations.’ He wouldn't tell you that
            you shouldn't do that before marriage." </p>
        <p>They were married on December 16, 1990. Two years later, they gave birth to a baby girl, Yukari. They now
            live in a metropolitan housing complex for people with disabilities in Nakano Ward, Tokyo, and with the
            support of a local volunteer network, they are busy with their daily life and raising their child. </p>
        <p>The child, Yukari, says: "Hello, Grandpa Iha, I'm going to have a birthday soon. I want a book." </p>
        <p>Yukari will soon be four years old."</p>
