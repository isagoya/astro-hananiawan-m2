            <p>In 1996, the August sun was still clinging to my back, making me sweat even though it was around five o'clock. </p>
            <p>“Ryo, this is where the nursery school used to be. You went there until you were six, and Yui was three," </p>
            <p>He pauses for a moment and looks around. </p>
            <p>“Yes, I remember. The pine trees are still there, and it's as if time has stood still here..." </p>
            <p>I wanted to tell him about his father's illness and the place of the pain of his youth. </p>
            <p>As we walked along the well-kept hedge path, we were greeted by passersby. </p>
            <p>“Hello...” </p>
            <p>The son's voice was nervous and even confused as he greeted them back. </p>
            <p>“Are all these people sick?” </p>
            <p>“No, to be precise, more than 95% of them are not sick but cured. In Japan, there are 13 national sanatoria for leprosy and two private sanatoria, and about 5500 people are still living in them. About 600 people live here in Tama Zenshoen. At present, fewer than 10 cases of leprosy occur in Japan per year. However, there are still 1,260,000 people affected by leprosy, mainly in Asia and Africa.” </p>
            <p>“Are there that many patients in the world?” </p>
            <p>“Most of them are in Asia and Africa. It is said that every disease is closely linked to society... poverty of life. The incidence of leprosy is said to be particularly correlated with the standard of living.” </p>
            <p>“You said that more than ninety-five per cent of people have been cured of their disease. Why are they still in sanatoriums when they are cured? And can I ask one more thing? Even now, there are 5,000 people living in sanatoriums. Why were we not taught any of this in school?” </p>
            <p>“That's an obvious question. When a person is diagnosed with leprosy, they are forcibly cut off from their family and community and placed in a leprosy sanatorium under the Leprosy Prevention Law. For a long time, once a patient was placed in a leprosy sanatorium, they were never allowed to return to their original society. The average age of those confined in this way is now over 70. Also, the problem is that you weren't taught about leprosy in school, but it could be said that leprosy sufferers were erased from the public eye through forced isolation. So, people never met the people with the disease. Have you ever seen or heard anything about leprosy before?” </p>
            <p>“No, very little. After I met you again, I did some research. Father, have you seen the movie ‘Ben-Hur’? Then I read Seicho Matsumoto's 'Vessel of Sand' and thought, oh, this is about leprosy, is that right?” </p>
            <p>“Yes.” </p>
            <p>“I see. But why is it such a dreaded disease, and why would someone commit murder to erase the past? I'm not convinced, but I thought it may be even more terrifying than 'Ebola'...”</p>
            <p> ---I see, nowadays the most frightening disease is Ebola... </p>
            <p>"It was formerly known as 'leprosy' (called 'Rai' in Japan), but the name has been officially changed to 'Hansen's disease'."</p>
            <p>“What kind of disease is it?” </p>
            <p>“It is a chronic infectious disease caused by the leprosy bacillus. The infection is said to be transmitted through the skin in infancy. You know the difference between infection and disease, don't you? Whether or not a person becomes ill after infection depends on their constitution. The onset of illness depends on the person's nutritional status, changes in physical condition, and the resulting immune system. Unlike other infectious diseases, this disease is also characterized by a long incubation period of several years. 'Did you see any features on the faces or hands of the people you just met?” </p>
            <p>“Yes, there were.” </p>
            <p>“Now that there is a cure, patients no longer suffer, but that is an unfortunate legacy of a time when there was no specific cure, an after-effect of the disease. There are two basic types of leprosy: lepromatous and tuberculoid. In the past, the progression of the disease caused paralysis of the sensory and motor nerves, and depending on the symptoms, hair and eyebrows may fall out, and edema may appear on the face. This dysfunction of the limbs and outward disfigurement became strongly persuasive in shaping the consciousness of the population, as it became associated with religious beliefs. Before long, only the 'special view of disease towards leprosy' began to take on a life of its own and, as a result, the social consciousness of lepers as subjects to be excluded was established."</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mt-5"></p>
            <p>My son listened attentively to my explanation.</p>
            <p>Eventually, we arrived at an area on the eastern edge of Tama Zenshoen that was particularly green. There, nestled amongst the trees, a stupa stood quietly.</p>
            <p>“Father, what is this place?”</p>
            <p>“It's an ossuary.”</p>
            <p>“Is this the Higashimurayama City ossuary?”</p>
            <p>“No, it's not. It's the remains of the people who died at the sanatorium."</p>
            <p>“Don't the remains of the deceased go into the graves in their hometowns?”</p>
            <p>“No, these people could not return home even after they died. The ossuary contains more than 3,600 of them. In leprosy sanatoriums all over the country, groups of more than 23,000 urns are wailing and wandering..."</p>
            <p>“The late Hitoshi Shimada sent me a letter of testament, a collection of poems entitled 'The Next Winter,' and I would like to share it with you. It is called 'Mona Lisa'.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mt-5 ms-4"></p>
            <br>The Mona Lisa's laughter is poisonous. <br />
            Knowing everything is perilous.<br />
            Leonardo da Vinci expressed that through the painting.</p>
            <p>Whoever is deprived of laughter on his face Counted 
            what was taken from him 
            His fingers have become crooked.</p>
            <p>When we can no longer live as we should <br />
            They are not good at crying either. <br />
            "Why did you give birth to me?"</p>
            <p>Mother. <br />
            Forgive me for being in the dark. <br />
            Leonardo. <br />
            It is true that you have lived too fast for your time.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mt-5"></p>
            <p>The son's body trembled as he stood there. </p>
            <p>“Father, wait a moment, I'll get some incense and flowers.”</p>

        <h2 id="perceptual-thread">Perceptual Thread</h2>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>It's been almost forty years since I lost all sensation from the elbows of my hands to the tips of my fingers and from the knees of my left leg to the tips of my toes.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Painful, hot, cold, soft... The signals from the peripheral nerves in the human body have lost their 'thread of perception' due to the after-effects of leprosy. </p>
            <p>My vision must keep running around constantly. The grayscale zone of 'warmth and softness' gets a temporary reprieve, but the danger signals of 'pain and hotness' must be quickly relayed to the brain so that defenses can be put in place. </p>
            <p>This fear of loss of perception has been continuing to assail me endlessly.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="ms-4"></p>
            <p>There is a knock on the door, and Asuke-san appears. </p>
            <p>“Executive Director Iha, tea is ready. Would you like to join us now?” </p>
            <p>I wonder if he is trying to be considerate of the fact that I have been talking very little in the last few days. The tea, which was always brought to my room, was served in the middle of the seats for everyone in the General Affairs Department. </p>
            <p>The room was bustling with six women. </p>
            <p>”Oh no! I was molested again today. Why did he do such a stupid thing? ... I can't forgive him anymore. If I meet him again, I'll report him.” </p>
            <p>“Rush hour on the commuter train, that's why I don't like it! I wish the office would adopt staggered working hours.” </p>
            <p>During a short break, Kimura, who had just joined the company this year, talked about the harassment she had experienced. </p>
            <p>“Well... I'd like to ask... Mr. Executive Director, have you also felt the same way as a man?” </p>
            <p>Kimura asked me with a serious expression. </p>
            <p>“It's the same for all men. Isn't that right, Mr. Executive Director?” </p>
            <p>“Yes.” </p>
            <p>I could only respond vaguely with a wry smile. Perverted impulses? I've never had anything inappropriate with my hands, First and foremost, I've lost the sense of touch in my hands.…</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="ms-4"></p>
            <p>“Executive Director, your white blood cell count is abnormal. There is inflammation somewhere in your body. Do you have any subjective symptoms? Please have a repeat examination.” </p>
            <p>Dr. Matsumura, the appointed doctor, looked anxious while reviewing the autumn medical check-up data. </p>
            <p>“Yes, I'll try to adjust my schedule.” “Please do so as soon as possible. I understand you're busy, but...” </p>
            <p>“I will. ...” </p>
            <p>It's finally here... </p>
            <p>The blood blister on my left sole, which had formed at the end of last year, had burst and become inflamed, and was already reaching its limit. </p>
            <p>Even if I walk a slightly longer distance, the pressure of my body weight causes the sole of my left foot to become calloused and thickened, and blood blisters form there. These blood blisters hardened after a few days of rest. However, this time, even a few days' rest was not possible. </p>
            <p>The inflammation gradually spread and deepened. Long-term bed rest? I don't know what to do... </p>
            <p>The bursting of the bubble economy had taken its toll on Tokyo Colony's operations. Given the current business situation, I was required to take the lead as a manager to break the deadlock.</p>
            <p>----The lives of 800 employees? </p>
            <p>----Hospitalization for 3-4 months during this busy time?</p>
            <p>This problem had been tormenting me for the past few months. </p>
            <p>My deformed left foot is red and swollen. As I looked at my sensory-deprived left leg, I thought. </p>
            <p>----For forty years… How you could have supported me.... </p>
            <p>I loved my feet.</p>
            <p>I can't chase two hares at the same time anymore... I have been running and running. My legs need some rest...... </p>
            <p>I chose to rest. To do this, I had to decide to retire. </p>
            <p>Looking back, it has been 40 years since I was diagnosed with leprosy, and none of the challenges - separation, restoration of function, fighting prejudice and discrimination, and my responsibilities as a manager - have been easy. However, each of these challenges was within the scope of my efforts. </p>
            <p>But only 'fear looming from the loss of perception' sometimes went beyond my 'area of effort'. And it played mercilessly with my life. This struggle may continue until the end of my life. </p>
            <p>In my 26 years of professional life, I have undergone four long-term treatments for left plantar perforation. All these surgeries involved skin grafts, etc., and each time required a several-month interruption from work. </p>
            <p>The benefits(?) of the Leprosy Prevention Act allowed me to use the leprosy sanatorium beds at any time, but I did not choose to do so. </p>
            <p>I was cured of leprosy, so I received treatment at a general medical institution for trauma caused by the aftereffects of leprosy, covered by health insurance. </p>
            <p>I did not want to make this principle ambiguous. Dr. Chozo Hashizume and Minoru Narita provided me with a general hospital bed each time. </p>
            <p>In general, disability due to malfunctioning functions is considered a problem that can be solved by preventive measures. For me, however, defense against sensory paralysis has always been a just-about-critical-point battle. </p>
            <p>The acquisition of a functional transformation that completely compensates for the perceptual impairment through vision is a task I have yet to fulfill. In this battle against trouble, my visual attention always needed to be fully engaged. Occasionally, the netting would break. </p>
            <p>'Anxiety and fear' were constantly closing in on me. It was as if a cloudy lethargy enveloped me... </p>
            <p>Information from the peripheral nerves that is innate and can be transmitted unconsciously—perception. We treat the gift, perception, so poorly. </p>
            <p>I sometimes dream that if I ...... </p>
            <p>If the heavens could grant me only one wish ... I would choose it without hesitation. </p>
            <p>I would like to feel the pain that makes me jump with my fingertips... I would like to feel the heat and softness in my palms... I would like to feel the warmth of a human being...</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="ms-4"></p>
            <p>The office of Minoru Narita, the Honorary Director of Tama Zenshoen, is only large enough for an office desk and a visitor's chair, and it is so cramped that it is hard to move around. </p>
            <p>“You seem as busy as ever.” </p>
            <p>“It's chores. Bethlehem Hospital, Prince Takamatsu Memorial Museum, and Zenshoen. A day goes by quickly.” </p>
            <p>“I have decided to retire from Tokyo Colony.” </p>
            <p>“I see. Thank you for your long years of service.” </p>
            <p>"Thanks to you, I have been able to continue working here. Thank you very much.” </p>
            <p>"No, I haven't helped much. I always wonder how much I, as a doctor, was able to empathize with you.... People can endure the suffering of others for any length of time. Doctors are the same way. Too often, we realize it in our later years. You may not have heard your feet, but the function of those limbs, which are not normal, were screaming to struggle with society. We, the doctors, were only sympathizing with the screams from your disabled parts. We did not go so far as to confront your minds... So, what are you going to do now?" </p>
            <p>“Well, I'm going to give this leg a bit of a rest. Besides, this is a good opportunity for me to summarize my long-held feelings about leprosy.” </p>
            <p>“I like it. The history of leprosy is like a long, dark tunnel. There is not enough light to see the whole picture.” </p>
            <p>“That's right.” </p>
            <p>"It's really great. Not the kind we write about in our imagination, but the kind of light that illuminates our history."</p>

            <p>"On January 1, 1994, I returned home with my wife, Shigeko. </p>
            <p>She asked me, "Are you really sure about your memory from 40 years ago?” </p>
            <p>My wife's voice was anxious, as she was constantly annoyed by my poor familiarity with the area. </p>
            <p>“I think it was around here. The man I asked for directions had said that Inabusmoh was that hill. I'm sure of it. From my old house, I could see Inabsumoh directly across the street..." </p>
            <p>"Be back here by six o'clock," my brother said, handing me a note with the address 212-1 Nakasone, Nakijin Village. </p>
            <p>I found the old house, which had two separate gates, each with the address 212-1 and 212-2 on the nameplate. </p>
            <p>“Shigeko, here it is, here!” </p>
            <p>The old house in Nakasone, Nakijin Village, was surrounded by a hedge of hibiscus flowers, which had been placed between the front gate and the house but had been turned into a block wall. </p>
            <p>“There was a large sandalwood tree in the garden, but it had been cut down too. ...It was the tree from which we were tied and hung if we misbehaved..." </p>
            <p>The hedge in my distant memory was neatly trimmed, and the red petals that held the morning dew in the gaps between the branches were in full bloom with their heads aligned. .......The fallen hibiscus flowers made a red band along the hedge. I was assigned to sweep the garden, and for some reason I liked to collect the straight band with a bamboo broom…</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="ms-4"></p>
            <p>“Let's climb up there, Inabsumoh.” </p>
            <p>I called out to her to climb it from my childhood memory, but when we rounded the hill, it took less than 10 minutes to reach it. The hill had been cleared and turned into a gate ball field, but it was late afternoon and only a few people were to be seen. </p>
            <p>“There used to be big pine trees scattered around the hill. Now those pine trees are gone..." </p>
            <p>From the hill, the houses shone in the white light. </p>
            <p>“Nice place, isn't it?” </p>
            <p>"Shigeko, right below you, you can see the ruins of my old house, the one we visited earlier." </p>
            <p>“ ...” </p>
            <p>“After the meal, the chindami of my father's sanshin (Okinawan traditional three-stringed instrument) would always start... Oh, chindami? That's an Okinawan dialect word for tuning the sanshin. At the sound of the chindami, the family would gather in the living room. My father, sitting in front of the Buddhist altar, was surrounded by his family. My grandmother and sisters were on the left, the boys on the right, and my mother near the kitchen. No, we weren't asked to listen to the sanshin politely. My sisters were playing with cradle, my elder brother Yoshiyasu and I were on our cheekbones, and another elder brother Kohken, a high school student, was reading a book. But during that time, no one was talking. An 80-watt light bulb hung from the ceiling in the center of the living room, and moonlight over Inabsumoh shone on the porch as I lay there. And only the sounds of the sanshin and chanting surrounded the family..." </p>
            <p>“When did your father die?” “February 20, 1979. He was 82 years old... It's been 15 years now...”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="ms-4"></p>
            <p>"When I returned to my parents' house in Gushigawa, there were shoes lined up in a small space at the entrance. </p>
            <p>My nephew, Yasushi, shouted from the doorway. </p>
            <p>“Uncle and aunt are back!” </p>
            <p>Shigeko and I were greeted with applause as we were shown into the room. </p>
            <p>“Congratulations on your marriage!” </p>
            <p>My niece Akiko, beaming, handed us a bouquet of flowers.</p>
            <p>Shigeko and I were dumbfounded by the unexpected situation. </p>
            <p>In the open living room, my mother, brothers, and sisters, nephews, and nieces—41 people in total—were present, and on the alcove was a sign in black ink: 'Congratulations on your marriage'. Everything had been planned without telling us. </p>
            <p>When we took our seats, the murmur of the forty-one disappeared for a moment. </p>
            <p>My brother, sitting in front of me, started to play the sanshin (a three-stringed guitar) and sing. The sound of the strings was followed by the two kotos (7-stringed Chinese zithers). ... my brother's wife, Kimiko, and his daughter, Isoko, plucked the strings. Their left hands glided over the strings…</p>
            <p>On the cushion prepared next to the elder brother, the father's sanshin (Okinawan guitar) was placed. </p>
            <p>Atsuko and her sister, Chieko, stepped out from the upper part of the stage and danced side by side."</p>

            <p>“I just can't find a replacement. I'm sorry, but this time you and Yui will have to go alone.” </p>
            <p>“...I don't have a choice, then we'll do that,” I said.</p>
            <p>I called my parents' home to inform them of the change of my return home. </p>
            <p>“Hello, brother. Shigeko's schedule is no longer available, but Yui and I will go there together.” </p>
            <p>“Can't you change the date of the trip to a day that suits Shigeko?” </p>
            <p>“I have to go to the interview, and Yui's schedule will also be affected, so this time I will go there with just the two of us.” </p>
            <p>The next day, my brother informed me of my mother's intention. </p>
            <p>“Mother says she can't do it by any means. She's quite angry. 'Toshio is mistaken. I won't allow him to return home alone with the child. If only you and Yui come, you must not take a single step inside the house,' she said. Toshio, what are you going to do?”</p>
            <p>These were unexpected words of rebuke from my mother. But I did not understand what she meant. She was so happy at that time.... What's going on? </p>
            <p>I had no choice but to ask my daughter to give up her trip to Okinawa this time and to go there alone for the interview.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mt-5"></p>
            <p>After greeting the Buddhist altar, I faced my mother.</p>
            <p>“Yoshiyasu and Toshio, come and sit here...” </p>
            <p>My mother's face was grimmer than ever. </p>
            <p>“Toshio, I have something to tell you. Do you understand what I meant when I gave you a stern warning the other day?” </p>
            <p>“...” </p>
            <p>“Toshio, you depend on Shigeko too much. Why can't you be more considerate of her feelings? When you left your children like that... you must have a lot of feelings. And even more so now that you could finally regain the relationship with your children. But whatever the circumstances, you were the one who cut off the parent-child bond. And now you're playing the role of father shamelessly. You are no longer allowed to have a parent-child relationship without Shigeko... Toshio, listen, from now on you must put Shigeko first in everything you do, not a parent-child relationship! Visiting your parents' home alone with your child? ... Five years ago, when you came to visit me with Ryo, you still hid the fact that you were divorced from Akiko. It couldn't be helped.... You don't understand! Thankfully, Shigeko was a good match and became my child. Perhaps Shigeko sincerely wanted to send you and your daughter here... but I won't allow it!” “...” “What grandparent wouldn't want to see their grandchildren? ... If you stray from the path of humanity, I must abandon my grandchildren! If you do so, I would only have Shigeko to choose from!” </p>
            <p>“...” </p>
            <p>“Yoshiyasu! Why can't you tell your brother this before I tell you?” </p>
            <p>“….” </p>
            <p>“Now that you're both here, I want to talk to you about something else…, about Toshio's divorce sixteen years ago... You may wonder why I'm bringing up such an old story now, but how could you cheat your parent for 13 years? I heard that you, seven daughters and sons, consulted with each other and decided to keep the secret on Toshio's divorce from me... You wouldn't tell me that until I die. Because you didn’t want me to be sad about Toshio, whom I cared about the most. Ullingattin nalan (I can't allow that either)! This kind of thing is called shallow thinking! It meant that I have made Toshio sad every time he came back. I had given you souvenirs for Ryo and Yui, that nobody received. And that too for 13 years... When I had to help you the most, I didn't do anything for you as your mother. You were all playing a trick on me. Until just before Toshio remarried Shigeko...” </p>
            <p>“...” </p>
            <p>“Yoshiyasu, Toshio. The family is always together.” </p>
            <p>The scent of incense surrounded us. </p>
            <p>“... when we cry, when we laugh... That's what family is.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mt-5"></p>
            <p>----Family---. Ever since I was diagnosed with leprosy, it has been like I was on a journey to find my family. </p>
