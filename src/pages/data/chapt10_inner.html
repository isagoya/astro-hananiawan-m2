            <p>Day after day, the year-end drinking parties continued.</p>
            <p>On Sunday mornings, when I can't shake off the hangover, I can only listen to Casals. On December 16, 1990, I was reading the newspaper while sipping my coffee, which was stronger than usual. Suddenly, the telephone rang... the early Sunday morning bell rang with a higher-than-usual pitch, especially on a dreary morning like this.</p>
            <p>“... Hello, hello, it's me.”</p>
            <p>“This is Iha. Who is this?”</p>
            <p>“This is Akiko. It's been a while.”</p>
            <p>"Ah, it's you..."</p>
            <p>It was an unexpected phone call from my ex-wife Akiko. The first time in ten years, her voice came through the receiver.</p>
            <p>“How are you?”</p>
            <p>“I'm fine. How are your children?”</p>
            <p>“Everyone is fine. ...and then there's a new...”</p>
            <p>“What?”</p>
            <p>“Have you remarried?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, I'm still single.”</p>
            <p>“Have you always been alone? Oh, I see.”</p>
            <p>“What's wrong?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, sorry. Sorry for the sudden phone call. Actually... Ryo... He really wants to see you. What should I do?”</p>
            <p>“What does your husband say?”</p>
            <p>“He says that Ryo is 18 years old, so he can't refuse to do what Ryo wants. He has given his consent. What should I do? ... I'm prepared...”</p>
            <p>“Prepared? What do you mean?”</p>
            <p>“...Ryo has been out of conversation with his new father ever since he was a freshman in high school... Ryo has been thinking to leave home when he finishes high school...”</p>
            <p>“Is your husband there?”</p>
            <p>“Yes. He's sitting right in front of me.”</p>
            <p>“... where's Ryo?”</p>
            <p>“He's in his room. Excuse me, but could you have a word with Ryo?”</p>
            <p>“... Uh, okay.”</p>
            <p>“Wait a minute. I'll get him now...”</p>
            <p>Through the receiver, I heard my son's footsteps running down the stairs.</p>
            <p>“Hello, this is Ryo. Dad, is it you?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, it's me...”</p>
            <p>“Can I go to Tokyo? Dad, may I come and see you? I'll be on winter break soon and I'd like to visit you in Tokyo on Sunday, December 23?"</p>
            <p>“Next Sunday? Have you discussed it with your family?”</p>
            <p>“Yes. I do!”</p>
            <p>“All right. Okay.”</p>
            <p>“Are you sure?... I'll be in Tokyo on the night of December 23.”</p>
            <p>“Okay. And what time do you want me to pick you up at Tokyo station?”</p>
            <p>“No, that's fine. I don't need a pick-up. I remember our house in Higashimurayama. I can go alone. I'd like to stay with you for a few days, please. Then I will now pass the phone to my mother.”</p>
            <p>“Hello, I'm sorry, but please take care of him.”
</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mt-5"></p>
            <p>On December 23, I was restless in the morning. I was at a loss as to how to greet my son, whom I hadn't seen for ten years. I was determined to be as calm as possible, but I was still preoccupied.</p>
            <p>…Ding-dong, the doorbell rang.</p>
            <p>“Good evening. I'm Ryo. It's me..."</p>
            <p>"Oh, it's unlocked."</p>
            <p>When I greeted him at the door, I saw my son with a bashful expression on his face. I looked at him, trying to find some semblance of my son when he left me at the age of eight.Alas, 10 years had passed, and I could not be certain by looking at his appearance that he was my son.</p>
            <p>----I can't even say hello to him when we pass each other on the street, I thought.</p>
            <p>"... I'm glad you're here. Well, come on up."</p>
            <p>“Dad, how are you?”</p>
            <p>“Yeah...”</p>
            <p>“I'd like to see my room first, Okay?”</p>
            <p>Ryo first took a slow turn around, starting with the room on the south side that was once the children's room.</p>
            <p>When I looked up, his eyes were wet.</p>
            <p>“You are gotten bigger...”</p>
            <p>“I'm 172 centimeters, that's normal. The furniture in my room is still the same as it was back then. Father, you didn't even remove the stickers that Yui and I put on it.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, because I'm lazy... Besides, it's the only thing you guys smell like.”</p>
            <p>'Thank you. When I arrived here, I immediately saw the front door nameplate. Both my name and Yui's name were still there... To be honest, I was worried. I came here worrying about what would happen if a woman I didn't know was written next to your name.”</p>
            <p>“I've had enough of this... I don't know how you got there. Did you get here without getting lost?”</p>
            <p>'Yes, I was fine. I got off at Higashimurayama Station and remembered Ito-Yokado.”</p>
            <p>“I see... Sit down first. Tea?”</p>
            <p>My son stared at my hand as I was making the tea.</p>
            <p>The road map of "North Tama, Tokyo", thrown out on a table, is in tatters, as if it had been repaired many times.</p>
            <p>“I bought this map with my fourth-year students' New Year's money. There's a new sports center opposite the junior high school, and I almost turned left onto a different road...”</p>
            <p>“How's Yui?”</p>
            <p>“Well, she says she's pushing hard now to prepare for the high school exams next year. It's better than doing nothing. but it's a little too late, isn't it? I'm saying...”</p>
            <p>“Well, where do you all live now?”</p>
            <p>“Hiroshima. We have another younger sister.”</p>
            <p>“I see. You have a new sister. Wouldn't that have been better for your mother?”</p>
            <p>"..."</p>
            <p>Ryo sat back down and put his hands on the table.</p>
            <p>“Dad! It's been ten years since you promised me...”</p>
            <p>“Ah…Ten years…”</p>
            <p>He remembered.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mt-5"></p>
            <p>"I'm with Dad. I don't want to go with Mum!" </p>
            <p>Two days before he left me, he had been crying, much to my annoyance. I had no choice but to take Ryo out to a bench in Frog Park behind the house and talk to him alone. </p>
            <p>“Your mother and Yui are both girls, aren't they? When they're in trouble, you should help them. You'll have to do your part,” I told him. </p>
            <p>“Why can't Yui and I stay with you, Dad? Because your hands are sore? Are Yui and I too small to help with cooking and cleaning, and does that bother you, Dad?” </p>
            <p>“Yes, Dad will be in trouble..."</p>
            <p> When I replied, Ryo's expression changed to the extent that I, as a parent, was astonished. </p>
            <p>"Dad, I understand. Yui and I are going with Mom. But when I can take care of myself, can I come to you, father?" </p>
            <p>"Yes." </p>
            <p>"Then what grade will I be in?" </p>
            <p>Saying this, he spread out his hands in front of me. </p>
            <p>"..." </p>
            <p>I folded all ten of my son's fingers on each hand. </p>
            <p>"Okay, Dad, when I'm in the tenth grade, right?" </p>
            <p>"Yes!" </p>
            <p>“But who will button your clothes from now on?” </p>
            <p>“Don't worry, I will do my best..." </p>
            <p>Every morning before I go to work, I buttoned my buttons with great difficulty. My son stared at me for a while, then said, "I will do it for you" and reached for my shirt. From that day onwards, buttoning my shirt before work became part of Ryo's routine. My son was worried about it.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mt-5"></p>
            <p>He was eight years old at the time, but ... he's now eighteen. </p>
            <p>“Father, can you change my surname back to Iha?" </p>
            <p>“What do your parents say?” </p>
            <p>“This is my problem... not theirs.” </p>
            <p>“That's not going to happen. Ryo, look, for whatever reason, I couldn't bring you up. In the end, it's the same as if I had abandoned you...” </p>
            <p>“No matter what you say, I am still Ryo Iha.” </p>
            <p>“Listen, your father in Hiroshima brought you up to this point, even though you're not related to him. No matter how much you thank him, it's not enough. Think about it with a human heart. This is the only thing that is unforgivable. Besides, family names are nothing more than social divisions..." “I want to be particular about who I am.” </p>
            <p>“No. Both Ryo and Yui should blame me for abandoning you for the rest of your lives and continue rejecting me.” </p>
            <p>“...Please tell me what happened between you and mother. Did you try your hardest for each other?” </p>
            <p>"..." </p>
            <p>“I've been teaching Yui since she was six years old. ‘Listen, this is a secret, our real father is in Tokyo.’” </p>
            <p>".. I'm sorry, it’s all my fault. I underestimated society. As a result, I crushed you. If you ask me how much effort I put in, I have no words. It may sound like self-defense, but the only thing I could do was to get you out of certain situations. Besides, your mother needed comfort as a woman." </p>
            <p>"...After all, children can't even choose our own surnames..." </p>
            <p>"..." </p>
            <p>"I... I never wanted to say this in public. But... I have been always lonely..." </p>
            <p>"..."</p>
            <p>"The discussion of changing the family name continued until morning." </p>
            <p>"I'm not convinced, but I'll hold off for now..." </p>
            <p>After these words, my son never mentioned the issue again. How he settled the matter in his mind, and what his true feelings were, remain unknown to me to this day. </p>
            <p>The next day, as I saw my son off at Tokyo Station, Ryo, standing in the doorway of the Shinkansen Hikari, approached me. </p>
            <p>"Dad, I'll be back. And then... find a woman you like soon." </p>
            <p>"That's none of your business!"</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mt-5"></p>
            <p>Ryo then received permission from his parents in Hiroshima to study for four years with financial support from me. In the end, I was left with no choice but to blame myself for the way I played the role of his own father, just as a form of financial assistance. </p>
            <p>I met my daughter Yui six months later at Hiroshima station, accompanied by Akiko, who thought Yui would not be able to recognize me on her own. When we stepped out of the ticket gate, a stiff-faced Akiko gave me a small wave of her hand. </p>
            <p>“How are you?”</p>
            <p>”How are you, too?"” ,”Yes."</p>
            <p>As we exchanged greetings, my daughter, who had just started high school, gazed at me. I patted her lightly and my daughter suddenly clung to my neck. </p>
            <p>That Yui, who always acted kittenish and sang 'Candy Candy', was hugging me. </p>
            <p>I was struck by the time I had left behind when I felt the bulge of her chest through the overcoat.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>It was December 1993 when Shigeko and I got married.</p>
            <p>My encounter with Shigeko began when I was preparing to return to society from a sanatorium for leprosy. During that time, I was going back and forth with the nursery school teachers at Akitsu Sanatorium for severely mentally and physically handicapped children.</p>
            <p>At the Higashimurayama Second Junior High School Zensho Branch in Tama Zenshoen, which had less than 10 students, a teacher lamented that she wanted the children to play softball as a class but could not organize a team. Hearing this, I decided to send personnel from the Akitsu Rehabilitation Center. I remember Shigeko as the smallest and most agile.</p>
            <p>For the next 25 years, we had no personal connection whatsoever. Occasionally, she would turn up at a culture school organized by the institution I ran, and we would exchange greetings.</p>
            <p>It was February 1993. As usual, I stopped at a supermarket after work to buy ingredients for dinner and came home to find a small package hanging on the doorknob of my front door. I opened it and found a two-tiered prepared dish with a letter inside.</p>
            <p>‘This is a stew made from country vegetables. I don't know if it will suit your taste. You don't have to return the container. From Kuma-chan.’</p>
            <p>The next day, I looked up the telephone number of the nursery school where she worked and called to thank her. Three days later, a sealed letter was thrown into my post.</p>
            <p>“I received an informal offer from the head of the childcare section to be the director of the nursery. I am not confident,” it said. The letter included her address and phone number.</p>
            <p>Until then, I never knew that her name was Shigeko Yanagisawa because the others always called her only 'Kuma-chan'.</p>
            <p>“Hello, this is Iha. The director's informal announcement, you should take it. Wouldn't it be good if you could take care of the children at their eye level?"</p>
            <p>Out of the blue, Shigeko appeared, and from that moment onward, we began to nurture our relationship. It was indeed a peculiar occurrence, but every conversation I had with Shigeko started to convey a warmth akin to peace of mind to my previously cold heart. My heart, which had remained closed to any form of encouragement for more than a decade, came back to life.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mt-5"></p>
            <p>“How was Kota's Ultraman transformation today?” </p>
            <p>“On the balance beam, he hunched over with his hands on his hips and his face red, and he said, ‘Well, not today either. I'll have to eat more rice. Auntie-teacher, I still can't put you on my back. I'll try it again tomorrow.' He was disappointed." </p>
            <p>It has already been six months since Kota became a topic of conversation during mealtimes. </p>
            <p>The daily news about the 100 children is truly delightful. It sometimes feels as if I know every one of the children, even their faces, though I have never met them. </p>
            <p>“Lunchtime today was interesting. You remember Yu, who has a disability that I told you about before? Haruka, a precocious child, always helps Yu and takes care of him. But unusually, during lunch, she was holding her bowl and crying. Haruka is quick at everything else, but when it comes to eating, she is always rushed by her nanny because it takes her so long.” </p>
            <p>As Shigeko spoke, she gestured how Haruka ate. </p>
            <p>“What's wrong with Haruka?” </p>
            <p>“When I came to the Lemon class, she had tears in her eyes and said, ‘Auntie-teacher, Yu is mean to me. Even though it's not a sports day today, Yu said to me, 'Keep up with it! Keep up with it!’” </p>
            <p>I started to laugh out loud.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the conversations make us think about the concept of time. </p>
            <p>“Auntie teacher, were you born during the war?” </p>
            <p>Kohei suddenly asked. </p>
            <p>“I wasn't born yet at that time...” </p>
            <p>“Hmm, I see. That's why you are alive now.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Shunsuke's proud display of his newfound knowledge was a testament to the richness of the conversation in the home.</p>
            <p>“The earth is moving,” </p>
            <p>Shunsuke proudly exclaimed, sharing his newly acquired surprise.</p>
            <p>“That's right.”</p>
            <p>“The earth is moving because humans are working hard, so the earth is in motion. Night and day come in turns.”</p>
            <p>“Is that so?”</p>
            <p>“Yes. And if children don't behave well, the movement of the earth will be particularly disturbed, and it will be night all the time.”</p>
            <p>The topics of conversation at the nursery school are endless.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="mt-5"></p>
            <p>Ryo, who got a job in Nagoya, and Yui from Hiroshima, also came to visit us at our new house in Tokyo.</p>
            <p>“Yui, do you remember the nursery school teacher, Atsuko? She said you were the most spoiled one. She was my best friend. She always told me stories about Ryo and Yui.</p>
            <p>Atsuko always used to say, ‘I have to look after them...'"</p>
            <p>"Atsuko-teacher? Ah, yes, I remember. Aunt Shigeko, is she fine?”</p>
            <p>“She got married and now lives in Akita.”</p>
            <p>Nowadays, when my children come to our house, they are more likely to see Shigeko, the three of us having fun with each other than with me.</p>
            <p>After a while, Ryo teased me.</p>
            <p>“Dad, well done. You've got a good eye for women, don't you? She is pretty good.”</p>
            <p></p>
