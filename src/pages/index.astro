						<h1>Introduction</h1>
						<p>In 1958, at the age of 15, I was celebrating my second June at Okinawa Airakuen, a sanatorium for Hansen's
							disease in Okinawa Prefecture.</p>
						<p>The Nobel Prize winner for literature, Yasunari Kawabata, spoke to me with his hand on my knee.
							<br />Saying, &quot;Write a lot. Store it all up inside you.&quot;
						</p>
						<p>I hear this call from the depths of my memory. This quiet voice led me to the joy of reading the books were
							filled with dreams that could flap their wings. There was no world where one person could humiliate another,
							or where a single &quot;stigma&quot; could deny a human life.</p>
						<p>Writing brings joy to people, and this conviction grew stronger as I grew older.
							I write about &quot;leprosy,&quot; which has passed over me. It has been over ten years since I became
							obsessed with this idea.</p>
						<p>The abolition of the Leprosy Prevention Law in April 1996 gave me the motivation to do so.</p>
						<p>Writing about the disease, is not a pleasant experience. It requires a great deal of determination to
							unearth the pain and recall the memories of a time gone by. And the deeper the grief and the heavier the
							pain, the more so.</p>
						<p>The act of recalling the memories of family members and others involved and connecting them through writing
							was also a journey of self-reflection. Like stop motion, scenes from that time and place come to mind—the
							sounds of that time, the colors I encountered, and even the scents I smelled.
						<p>The act of &quot;marking oneself&quot;, begins with dismantling myself. Then, I must create a self that can
							look at myself calmly.
						<p>Before writing about the past, I tried to maintain a bird's-eye view of it as much as possible.</p>
						<p></p>
						<div class="spacer"></div>
						<p>In the &quot;House for Prayers&quot; in Airakuen, the sermon &quot;The Last Supper&quot; by Tokuda, a
							Sunday School teacher, spoke to the anxious heart of a 14-year-old.
						</p>
						<p>Leonardo da Vinci started drawing with Christ in the center. It was easy to find his model, as well as
							models of the disciples. However, he could not find the last remaining model of Judas.</p>
						<p>Da Vinci traveled for days and days across the country in search of a model of Judas.</p>
						<p>he stepped into one town, he found a crowd of people shouting jeers in their mouths, saying, &quot;Strike
							the thieves! Hit the criminals harder!&quot; Perplexed, Da Vinci stretched his head and peeked into the
							crowd, only to see a beggar being beaten by the shopkeeper. The beggar was crying and asking for
							forgiveness, but it didn't look like he was going to get it.</p>
						<p>Da Vinci felt sorry for the beggar and gave some gold coins to the shopkeeper, finally rescuing the crying
							beggar. The beggar prostrated himself at da Vinci's feet, thanked him for saving him, and kissed his feet.
							As the beggar raised his tear-stained face, he smiled.</p>
						<p>Da Vinci realized that this beggar was the very Judas he had been looking for all along.</p>
						<p>He rushed the beggar back home and was finally able to paint Judas.</p>
						<p>At last, &quot;The Last Supper&quot; was completed.</p>
						<p>Da Vinci gave the beggar gold coins in return. The beggar, clutching the gold coins, said, <br />&quot;Sir,
							I have been given coins from you twice. The first time was when I finished this man's modeling.&quot;
							<br />The beggar's finger pointed to the center of the completed The Last Supper.</p>
						<p>The eyes of the 14-year-old boy sitting in the second row, far right seat in the church hall, caught sight
							of Christ and Judas.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>The eighty-nine years of "bad law" for leprosy is a history of forcing those who are sick to abandon their
							humanity. Therefore, the tears of those who were stigmatized continued to be shed without drying up.</p>
						<p>Leprosy Prevention Law, which caused so much suffering and sorrow for mankind, drew its curtain so easily
							against the weight of its sordid history. Society has left lepers behind and forgotten that they even exist,
							and now it is trying to erase and bury them as peacefully as possible from Japan’s medical history.</p>
						<p>What were the 89 years imposed on leprosy patients? Japanese people living in Japan today have a
							responsibility to answer that question.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>book is a memoir of my life and a message from a leprosy survivor to my readers. It is my hope that as many
							people as possible will read this book and reflect on it in your own hearts.
						<p>In some parts of this book, the term "leprosy" is used for historical references and proper nouns, but all
							references to the disease are now referred to as "Hansen's disease."</p>
