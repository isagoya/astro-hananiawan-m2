<!-- # Stigma -->

## The Gate of Holly Tree

I entered the Central Labor Institute in April 1967.

The majority of the students were young people who studied while working, and there were several current college students. The classroom was filled with enthusiasm because the social situation at that time was prosperous, with the birth of the innovative Tokyo Governor Minobe and just before the campus riots. The main reason I chose this institute was because of its low tuition fees. Besides, it was the summer of my 21st year, my last year of high school, and I had been reading books unsystematically to find some clue for my way of life, as if I were obsessed with something, and my body was hot from reading Russian novelist Maxim Gorky's (1868-1936) “The Life of Klim-Samgin.” The way academics engage with society grabbed me and wouldn't let go.

 I saw myself in Samgin. Samgin put his life in a place where he had no material or spiritual connection to the Russian Revolution, he was empty, only narcissistic, out of touch with historical events, pretending to be a revolutionary without a real heart, and saw himself as a victim of history. As I read on, I felt that I was being accused of the mask of my mind.

I really wanted to get rid of the stigma of the disease that hung over me and did not even allow me to live a normal life.

 If I could not escape the blockade of “society and disease,” I could not even be sure of my own “life.” First of all, I would learn about the structure of society as an academic subject, I was preoccupied with the idea.

 The Central Labor Institute was in Minato Ward, Tokyo, and it took me about two hours to get there. I took a bus from Tama Zenshoen in Higashimurayama City to Kiyose Station, then took the Seibu Ikebukuro Line and the Yamanote Line and got off at Shibuya Station. Then I changed to a Toden train to Kanasugibashi and got off at Sannohashi. It was exactly the east-west direction across Tokyo to go to school.

 The daily two-hour class began at 7:00 p.m., and I had to leave Tama Zenshoen at 4:30 a.m. to make it to the start of the school day.

 At that time, my income consisted only of a living benefits and a disabled welfare pension, so after paying for tuition and transportation, only about 400 yen left.

I saved money to buy books and spent weekends going to second-hand bookstores in Kanda, and I was finally able to get some that I wanted to read. I was lucky to belong to the sanatorium because I got three meals a day and a place to stay, and compared to the nearly 100 students sitting side by side in the classroom, I was probably one of the luckier ones.

 It was around this time that my youngest sister, Chie, came to visit me in Zenshoen, and she was surprised to see how poor my life was.

“Toshio, your father wanted me to give you this.”

She gave me 20,000 yen as she left. Although I knew the source of the money was clearly part of her salary, I had no choice but to accept her lie.

 It's been about two weeks since I enrolled. I was greeted by three young men and women who approached my seat during the break.

“Mr. Iha, you're from Okinawa, right? I guessed it from the attendance book.”

“We are from Iejima. My name is Kinjo. Nice to see you.”

“My name is Taira.” “I am Kaneshiro.”

 For a while after that, the conversation in the classroom was limited at most to that group of two women and a man from Iejima. I rarely talked to them myself.

 From our brief conversation, I learned that they were about 20 years old and were sent by Ahagon Shokou, president of the “Iejima Land Protection Association,” which continues to protest land confiscation by the U.S. military.

 I always sat in the front row in the middle of the classroom. This was because I always wanted to escape as much as possible from the gaze cast on my hands. In the middle of the front row, I only had to look at the professor.

 I can name only four or five classmates, although I attended almost every class for two years, except for three days when I was sick in bed. This shows how much I avoided contact with others at that time.

 Anyway, I was afraid of the stares of the people around me.

 On the street or in the train, piercing cold eyes would drive me into a corner. For that reason, I always kept my hands in my pockets.

The characteristic of people with Hansen's disease was that each of them began preparing for the end of their lives as soon as they were diagnosed. It was not because they were convinced of their disease as incurable, nor because they despaired of it as a fatal disease. It was because the patients themselves came to this conclusion, overwhelmed by the social perception of Hansen's disease.

 The life of medical treatment, which is supposed to cure the illness and restore life, also drives the mind of the sick person into a corner with time, and soon he or she begins to undermine himself or herself by thinking, “My illness is a special one.”

 The "unjust and unfounded social judgment"... the whispers of the "monster", which the patient himself denies with conviction, gradually lead him to prepare to give up being human. And thus the stigma of “Hansen’s disease” settles in the darkness of his heart.

 The stigma remains with them for the rest of their lives, even after the disease is cured, dragging them throughout their lives and never freeing them from it. Therefore, they try to deal with it by hiding the disease thoroughly, erasing certain periods of their lives and personal histories.

 Even in conversations among those involved, they are very careful in their efforts to conceal their past, even using secret language. For example, “this disease” means “Hansen's disease,” “in or inside” means “sanatorium.”

 No matter what happens, they would not say, “I contracted Hansen's disease and was cured after being treated in such and such a sanatorium.”

“The Leprosy Prevention Law”, considered the worst of all laws, was repealed in 1996. Perhaps the greatest crime of this law is that it pushed the Hansen's disease patients and their families into a corner under the pretext of “special feeling of illness,” even depriving them of the meaning of being born into this world.

 At that time, I was no exception.

From time to time, the remnant shows up in my behavior today. When I feel someone's eyes on me, I unconsciously hide my hands with a start.

 Tama Zenshoen is surrounded by a hedge of holly. Whenever I walked through the hedge into the sanatorium, I would stand there for a while. Then I would take a deep breath. The feeling of relief of “finally coming back to our world” made me like that.

 Although I was able to go to school because the lectures were attractive enough to let me go. I wanted to know the true identity of the “social structure” that overshadowed me. Whatever it was, I was looking for the clue.

 One by one, the problems that had been vague and unsolved became clear. The classroom was full of surprises every day.

 It had been four months since I entered the school.

 “May I sit here?”

Then he sat down to my left, Mr. Yamaguchi, one of the members of the student council.

“My name is Yamaguchi. Nice to meet you.”

“My name is Iha.”

 “Oh, Iha. How do you write it?”

I wrote “Iha” in Chinese characters on my notebook and showed it to him.

“Oh, it reads 'Iha', that's unusual, isn't it?”

“I work in Shibuya, so I thought I could get to class before everyone else, but you are always first. Is your office close to the school?”

“No, it's Higashimurayama. I'm a little out of shape, so I don't have a job right now.”

 “Higashimurayama? The one from Tama Lake?”

 I prepared my answer in case he asked me about my deformed hands.

“I can't keep my hunger down until nine o'clock, so excuse me.”

He began to pour bread and milk into his extraordinarily large body. Then he started going through his text books.

## In My Pockets

That day, I arrived at Shibuya Station an hour earlier than usual to buy my commuter pass.

“Mr. Iha, you're quite early today.”

Mr. Shigeo Hatada, a professor of international politics who would later run for governor of Tokyo, greeted me.

“Hello. I came to buy my commuter pass.”

 “Did you get it?”

“Yes, I did.”

“Okay. If you don't mind, would you like to have tea with me?”

I nervously followed him across the bridge to Tokyu Plaza. He took a table by the window of the coffee shop and asked me if I would like a cup of coffee.

“You're from Okinawa, right?”

“Yes, I am. But it has been seven years since I left Okinawa.”

“Who was the young pastor who participated in the inauguration of Mr. Unger, the High Commissioner of the Ryukyu Islands, November 2 of last year? His 'prayer’ before the new High Commissioner was very moving for us. That prayer was not only for the High Commissioner, but for all the Japanese on the mainland, including myself.”

 I was so happy. The professor mentioned Rev. Taira's prayer.

 “His name is Pastor Osamu Taira!”

 It was customary for pastors to pray at the inauguration ceremonies of successive High Commissioners, but this 33-year-old local pastor made an appeal that could be described as unusual. He prayed.

“Because of the threat of war, Okinawa is separated from its homeland. God, we sincerely hope that peace will come to the world as soon as possible, that the new High Commissioner will be the last, and that Okinawa will return to its normal state. Please let this new High Commissioner bow deeply before the dignity of the human rights of these citizens.

 Afterwards, we had a little chat.

“By the way, Mr. Yamaguchi was worried about. He said, 'No matter how much I talk to Mr. Iha, he won't be open with me.' You are becoming our topic among teachers because your eyes are always shining in class. May I suggest that you be a little more aggressive?”

 I was grateful for my friend's good will, but my hands were still under the table.

 “Do you have any plans for the upcoming Obon holidays? I'm going back to Kumamoto after a long time. How about coming to my house if you want, it's in the rural area of Kumamoto…”

 After the bell rang to end the lesson, Yamaguchi invited me to join him.

“Thank you... Sorry, but I have something to do...”

He stared at me for a moment.

“Do you really have a plan?”

 He asked me back in an unusually strong tone.

I had been invited many times. Invitation to student government meetings, to hikes and to his room. But my answer was always the same.

“I have another plan...”

“Maybe some other time...”

Until then, this kind of conversation had been a “well, that's too bad” and not continued. But that day it was different.

 “Tomorrow is Saturday, so you won't mind coming back late. Come with me today, no matter what! Are you okay? Don't run away from me!”

I was dragged out of the classroom.

The small restaurant “Yoshimura” was in front of the Sannohashi station, down the hill from the institute.

“Hello!”

 The restaurant was deserted, with only a few customers at the counter, who seemed to be regulars.

 “I'm Yamaguchi, I called you earlier.”

 “We have your reservation for two. Please go to the back room.”

 Mr. Yamaguchi urged me to have some food, but I refused, saying, “No, thank you.

“Then let's have some beer. Three beers, please. And some edamame too.”

Although he had made the reservation, his order ended with only beers.

“If you have any other orders, please call us.”

 Since a few minutes ago, I had been feeling anxious because of the completely unpredictable course of events.

We had a routine toast.

“Now, I will tell you my story. That doesn't mean I am urging you to tell your story instead. You can just listen and pass it off.

He took off his glasses, sat up straight, and opened his mouth.

“When I was a sophomore in high school, I was a bad boy and caused a lot of trouble around me. Before I knew it, I was flattered to become the leader of the gang. There was an agricultural high school in the next town and we were always in trouble with them, once a trivial matter led to a big fight between the bad boys. You know, I thought I was pretty sophisticated back then. I decided that this was the day to settle the matter with the leader of the group I was fighting with. I went into the fight with a hidden knife. To be honest, the knife was meant as a threat. But as it turned out, the other guy was seriously injured. So I was sent to juvenile detention for two years. That's the classic course. And I couldn't go back to that high school, and after that I came to Tokyo and finally graduated from night school.

He stopped talking and glared at me.

 “It may be a nuisance to you, but your existence bothers me in a strange way,” he said, swallowing the rest of the beer in his glass.

“For some reason I can't bear to look at you.”

His words stopped and there was a pause.

“I don't know why, but I feel miserable! I can hardly stand it!”

Yamaguchi's words hit me hard. Suddenly, I began to think that he must be the only one I can...

“Thank you...Yamaguchi, have you ever heard of Hansen's disease?”

 He shook his head.

 “They usually call it leprosy. I have recovered from the disease!”

 He looked surprised.

I began to regret that I shouldn't have told him.

“No, wait a minute, maybe, I think I’ve heard of a sanatorium for such patients in Nishigou Village Kikuchi Ward, near my house.”

 “That's it! There is a sanatorium for these patients.”

My hand like this is the after-effect of that disease.”

I waved my hands in front of my face.

 “Is it because of the disease?”

 “Yes. I have repeated surgeries, but it is still not enough.”

 “But your disease is cured, isn't it?”

 “Yes, it is.”

 Suddenly, Yamaguchi threw the wet napkin at me.

“You bastard! This is even stranger, isn't it? In my case, I did it myself. There is no excuse for that from my side. Do you blame yourself for your disease! I was sent to juvenile detention from my own human nature. That’s why I am too ashamed to face the world. Even with my whole life, I can't atone for my sins. But your sickness, your disease, has nothing to do with your human nature, doesn't it?

Yamaguchi's loud voice echoed through the small room and tears came to my eyes.

That one word from Yamaguchi had changed me almost too easily.

 From that moment on, my hands began to come out of my pockets just as they were.

 Mr. Yamaguchi died seven years later in a traffic accident while serving as a member of the provincial city council.

## Soft Landing

Two young ladies who had heard of me came to see me at Tama Zenshoen.

“We are Ms. Asayama and Ms. Kusakai. We work for Akitsu Rehabilitation Center, the home for severely retarded children. We will be showing the movie 'Children Before Dawn' at Yasaka Elementary School tonight. Please come and join us.”

“As a matter of fact, there are many tickets left.”

“How much is it?”

“Two hundred yen.”

Two hundred yen was a lot of money for me, but her sincere attitude impressed me enough to buy the ticket on impulse.

“Okay, I'll take one. By the way, what kind of movie is it?”

The girl who called herself as Kusakai, hastily held out the flyer with a flushed face.

“Please read this flyer, there are details in it.”

 “It begins at seven o'clock. We expect you to come.”

I read the explanation on the flyer.

-----Itoga Kazuo, Biwako Gakuen, Cerebral Palsy, Development Assurance----

 Every word and name were new to me.

----- Every child has the right to develop-----

 Somehow, I was attracted to Dr. Itoga's words.

There were smiling children whose faces were distorted because of their disabilities, and sweat dripping from the foreheads of the staff taking care of the bedridden children.

I wondered why? The existence of “Hansen's disease”, which I could hardly erase from my mind, was getting smaller and smaller ---.

“Everyone grows up.” The word made my body hot.

“Mr. Iha, how did you like the movie?”

Ms. Asayama asked me as I left the room.

“Thank you for inviting me to the movie.”

“I'm glad to hear that. I was afraid I might have pushed you too hard.”

 “Mr. Iha, we are about to have the review meeting. Could you please join us? Tomorrow night at seven o'clock, in my room.”

  I gave her a vague answer.

“Just a minute. I'll write down the way to my room for you.”

Ms. Kusakai smiled at me and said, “Please join us, we'll expect you there.”

 The next day, it was after seven, and I still could not make up my mind. Anyway, it was the first time for me to go to a stranger's house that was not a sanatorium.

 When I finally made up my mind and left the room, it was 30 minutes after the appointed time. To get to the place on the information paper, I would go straight down the road from the back gate of the Zenshoen to the Akitsu Station.

 I arrived at the Daiichi Fuji House without getting lost. The directions showed a room on the second floor, on the far left.

 I knocked on the door and entered the room and was stunned. The small room was crowded with a dozen ladies sitting in a circle.

I did not know the reason, but they all greeted me with applause.

 “Let me introduce you. Today's main guest, the only prince, has arrived!”

 I was completely distracted by the unexpected situation.

“My name is Iha Toshio. Nice to meet you.”

Then they resumed their conversation. I just listened to their conversation.

----- They are the girls from Akita Prefecture on the front page of the newspaper.

They dedicate themselves to helping children with severe physical and mental disabilities at the facility..."Angel girls," I thought. Looking just a few years out of high school, they leaned forward and talked as if they couldn't wait for someone else's talk to end.

I was only overwhelmed by them.

“What is Ryouiku (education and support for disabled children)?” “What is support?” “What is child development security?”

Their discussion was filled with a new quality that I had never experienced before. Then the discussion turned to specific problems in their workplaces.

“Sayo, I think the way you talk to A. is wrong. You should stop using baby talk. Even if he is mentally handicapped, we should talk to him in his own age-appropriate way.”

“Obuchi, you should stop talking only to B., that's against the policy we have decided.

 They had no mercy for each other. As they became more agitated, their voices rose and the local Akita dialect began to mix in.

From time to time, a girl who introduced herself as Nakamura, the nurse, spoke up.

“Your voice is too loud. Lower it a little.”

-----I see, she must be the coordinator of the group.

 As I watched them outside the circle, I began to understand each of their positions.

There are girls who are so passionate about their “work” and “children”. I even began to have a kind of respect for them. At first, they interrupted their discussion and politely welcomed me as a guest, but as the discussion heated up, they completely forgot about my existence, which somehow made me feel comfortable.

 After that, I had a good relationship with the girls at Akitsu Rehabilitation Center for a long time.

 My second wife Shigeko was one of them. The days I spent with them opened my closed mind before I knew it.

 The “society” I had thought of as a distant world began to become visible. My heart needed time for a “soft landing,” but these girls also helped me prepare my mind to return to society.

## The way back

In March 1969 we had the graduation ceremony at the Central Labor Academy.

 I was proud only of my attendance, but to my surprise the office manager told me that I had been chosen to represent the graduates of that generation. To this day I realize that this honor was based on the standard of “hard worker.

 Without hesitation, I extended my hand to Mr. Hori Makoto, the headmaster, and shook his hand in return.

 “Congratulations! You did a great job.”

 “Thank you very much.”

 I had decided in my mind to put an end to the sanatorium life that had lasted almost twelve years.

Therefore, in February, I applied to leave the sanatorium and talked face to face with Ms. Sato, the caseworker, in the meeting room of the annex office.

 “Mr. Iha, because of you, I'm sure it's after careful consideration, as always, but you're trying to do something very difficult.”

 “Ms. Sato, I will tell them that I am cured of my illness. Of course, I will not hide the fact that it was Hansen's disease.”

 “Oh, that's outrageous. May I tell you that I've sent out many people who have been cured of the disease to the society. Most of them have no after-effects. Even those who returned to society hid all their past... In your case, the aftereffects of Hansen's disease are obvious to everyone, so...”

 “That's why I can't escape it...so the only way is to live face to face with Hansen's disease.”

 “You can't take today's society lightly. They stubbornly reject people who have recovered from Hansen's disease. Especially your after-effects can make things difficult. The conversation between the social worker and me went on and on.

 “It's apparent, that you'll be mangled and torn apart...”

 “Still, there is no other way for me to live... “

 Ms. Sato reluctantly agreed.

 “I see. Since you have made such a firm decision, we'll support you with all our efforts."

In the consultation room, I was half naked, surrounded by the director, Yajima Ryoichi, Dr. Hazama, Dr. Hirako, Dr. Ohira, Dr. Narita, and the case worker, Ms. Sato.

 Dr. Hirako reported about me.

 “The applicant did not need to take Dapsone (DDS)[^1] for eight years. The test results of his whole tissue samples show his perfect recovery.”

 Finally, Director Yazaki examined me by touch and announced.

 “Now we unanimously approve Mr. Iha to leave the sanatorium.”

 Then Mr. Yazaki asked me directly.

 “Have you found a job yet?”

 “I am to work as a medical secretary at a hospital in Tachikawa that Dr. Hazama introduced me to.”

“I see. That's good to know. After all, this is the first time I have received an application to leave the sanatorium with a limb condition like yours, so that is the only thing I am concerned about.”

 “He always does his best, you know.”

 Ms. Sato said, and it sounded like my mental strength was the only thing I could rely on against the director's concerns.

 The worried looks on the faces of all the doctors there did not go away.

Dr. Hirako called to me as he wrote on my medical report.

 “Mr. Iha, you are always welcome to come back if you feel you can't do your best."

“Thank you very much. But I have no intention of going through that gate again!"

[^1]: In 1943, the American Faget announced that a derivative of the sulfonamide drug Promin was effective as a treatment for leprosy. In Japan, after the war, Morizo Ishidate, a former professor at the University of Tokyo, succeeded in synthesizing the drug. Promin was injected intravenously. Subsequently, Dapsone was developed as an oral drug, paving the way for outpatient treatment. Rifampicin was subsequently developed. Since 1983, multidrug combination therapy (DDS, B663, and rifampicin) has been the mainstay of treatment. With this combination therapy, leprosy loses its infectivity in a few days.
