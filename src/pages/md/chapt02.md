<!-- # Yagaji Island -->

## Deigo flowers (Erythrina variegate)

  In October 1955, “gray-faced buzzard eagles crossed the clear sky in rows.
My brother and I had just returned from the sports day and were busy making baked sweet potatoes in the cattle pen at the back of the house.
“Shove out the ashes in the fireplace or the fire won't burn.” My brother shoveled the ashes out with a fire shovel.
“Two for each of us,” he said, “ cover them with ashes well.”
All of a sudden, my brother shouted.
“Toshio! Your shoe is burnign! Your shoe...”
Smoke came out of my left shoe. I looked at my brother who was screaming and throwing water on it.
“Oh no, my shoe is on fire. My left foot...”
But I felt strange. No pain, no heat. I was took to Ishikawa's clinic, and seeing the panic of the doctors and nurses as they treat with me, I cried out for the first time.
“It hurts, it hurts.”
I was crying and feeling strange. I could see the scissors tearing my shoe and cutting the skin on the soles of my feet, but I felt no pain.
This burn was completely healed by May of the following year.
Something unusual was happening to my body. The whole nerves of my body began to bristle and pain began to run through my body. The pain struck me day and night. No matter what part of my body was touched, an electric pain shot through my head.
December came, and the clinic director began to tilt his head in doubt.
“Father, I'm afraid, but it looks like his illness is not a normal.
I coule hear unfamiliar words as they whispered to each other.
“----Yagaji----- Leprosy...”
“No one in my family has this disease!”
I heard my father's loud denial.
The director of Ishikawa Clinic began to show loss of orientation about my treatment. “I will refer you to Fukumoto Hospital in Goya, please go there.”
Goya is located in Koza City (now Okinawa City), about a 30-minute bus ride from Ishikawa City, where we lived.
My father carried me on his back to the hospital every day. My height had stopped growing since I was in lower elementary school. In those days, I stayed out of school and went to the hospital every other day read books and newspapers when I was at home.
 One day I happened to look at the newspaper, and the words “Yagaji,” “Airakuen,” and “leprosy” jumped into my eyes. I greedily read the article over and over again.
“Ah!”
------“Yagaji” Now I know, the word the director mentioned meant the name of the place “Yagaji!
Strangely enough, at that moment I convinced that my illness was leprosy.
However, the diagnosis and treatment at Fukumoto Hospital were based on the disease called “childhood neuritis,” and no declaration of “leprosy” was made.
To stop the severe pain, “Irgapirin” injections were started. My father paid 200 B yen in cash for each injection. B yen was the currency under the U.S. military regime from 1948 to September 1958: rate dollar to 120B yen to 360 yen). At that time, the monthly salary of the Ryukyu government chief was 24,000B yen.
He spent 200 yen like water every day.
Even as a child, I felt my heart constricted thinking of the value of that money.
I am not sure if it was the effect of the injections, but the pain that ran through my body began to disappear. On the contrary, the sensation of my arms from the elbows to the tips of the fingers gradually disappeared. Then my fingers of both hands began to bend toward the palm side, and both wrists lost their power to lift toward the back of my hands and became drooping.
It was May and I was thirteen years old.
My father's back was sweaty, and his scent filled my nostrils as I waited on his back for the bus.
--- It is the time! I have to say it now, I have to say it soon...
The impulse surged up.
“Dad, Dad, okay, that's enough. Let's stop this. Don't spend any more money! No, you shouldn't ... My illness can't be cured in this hospital anymore, I should go to Yagaji to be cured!”
I burst into tears at the moment I finished saying. I could feel the shuddering surprise of my father through his trembling arms. Then, without a word, he clenched his hands again and suddenly left the bus stop, crossed Route 13 in a short run, and entered the Block Factory grounds.
He put me down on the block. In the late afternoon, the block factory was neatly lined with half-dried blocks and no one in sight.
“Toshio! Who told you that? Who told you...? Even though you're a kid... you're just a kid...”
He slapped me on the cheek. Tears streamed from his eyes as he continued slapping.
My eyes, blurred with tears, saw the Deigo flowers overhanging the fence. Over my father's shoulder, I could clearly see the red petals of the Deigo flowers.

## Sanyama-bushi (Ryukyuan Classical Music)

  In October 1956, I returned to the first grade of junior high school.
“Toshio, come here.”
On every breaking time, my teacher, Ms. Yagi Sizu, would beckon me to her side. Ms. Yagi wrapped my little crooked hands and massaged them over and over again. This continued until March of the following year. In contrast to the warm feeling of Mrs. Yagi, my heart was somehow cool.
-----She is wasting her time....
It was not certain whether Dr. Fukumoto recomended it or not, a new electrotherapy session was added to my after-school routine. However, instead of restoring function to the limbs, the more the treatment , the more it took away the function of my limbs.
On April 30 of the following year, a regular group medical examination was held at Ishikawa Junior High School.
When my turn was over, the school doctor began trembling for some reason. He dipped his hands deep into the disinfectant and raised his voice rubbing his hands vigorously.
“Call the health department and get his parents here as soon as possible!”
Contrary to those panic, my heart was filled with a sense of relief.
“Now, at last…”
They said, my desk and chair were burnt down in a corner of the playground a few days later.
My mother still mentions it sometimes with regret.
“I resent that. I wanted them to set it on fire, at least where no other students could see it...”
On May 1, I was supposed to receive medical treatment at the Koza Central Hospital on the orders of the Health Center.
At six in the morning, I tied the rope to the beam of the outside latrine. Just when I raised up body to hang my head from the rope, my sister Fumiko knocked on the latrine door.
“Toshio, hurry up! How dare you stay there so long?”
“Oh... no... “
In a great hurry, I removed the rope, wrapped it around my waist, covered it with my shirt, and then switched with her.
The column clock of Central Hospital struck 9:00.
I was already stripped naked in the consulting room, but my heart was filled with something close to determination and all the scenery around me disappeared from my eyes. I only stared at the doctor's name plate, which read “ Tajiri Isamu, invited doctor by the Ryukyu government.
“I am sorry to say, but I am sure of his disease as leprosy. He told my father clearly.
“I will make contact with Airakuen. Please let him enter tomorrow. Your name is Toshio. Okay, you're 14 years old. If you start the treatment now, you will certainly recover.”
My father said nothing until we got home.
When we got home, my grandmother was waiting for us alone, sitting with her back to the altar.
My father sat upright in front of her and spoke quietly.
“Tomorrow, I will take Yosho to Airakuen.”
My grandmother uttered a voice that sounded like a scream as she listened to his report.
“Watta chisujini unu pyoukinumuuya uran! (No, no one in my family has this disease!)”
Then she stood up with a loud clucking of her tongue and walked in front of me without saying a word to me. My grandmother was still proud of her samurai family, the Iha family, as she used to say. The only pride she had fell to the ground when her grandson was declared a leper.

“Toshio, come and sit here.”
My father sat me down in front of the Buddhist altar. Then he took out a vermilion-painted sanshin (Okinawan traditional three-stringed instrument) box from the back of the closet. He had cut off the strings of sanshin by himself when his second son Okinori committed suicide at the age of 22 in August 1953.
He had been devastated by the death of his proud son who had just passed the first public examination for the newly established University of Ryukyu.
When he finished changing the strings, he took a deep breath.
Then he began to sing in a low, long, muffled voice. My grandmother leaned her back against a pillar and listened to him.
“Makotoka... jichika... wa... chimu... furi... burrito...”
As a 14-year-old boy, that was all I could remember what came out from his mouth. With this faint memory as a clue, I searched for the lyrics of that time. Only after 40 years I could find out the lyrics.

“Brother, I'm looking for some Ryukyuan song. Do you have any book that will be of my help?”
“Here it is. This book is the most detailed.”
He handed me a book called “Ryukashu” (Ryukyu Song Anthology) written by Shimabukuro Seibin.
  I began to search for the lyrics that began with “Makotoka, Jichika...”It was only a fine thread of memory.
“Makotoka... jichika...”
“Ah, here it is! I found it!”
 ---Makotoka Jichika Wachimu Furiburito Nizami udoruchinu Yuminukukuchi (Is this true and real, my heart is awake, amazing and dreamy)
   The title was written, “Sanyama-bushi”.
“This is it...it must be the one. I have finally found out...”
A note was attached to it , saying “Discern the suitable occasion to sing.”
“Brother, I would like to hear Sanyama-bushi.”
“You're interested in a rare song not played so often, any reason?”
“Why is not played so often?”
“Because it's a farewell song.”
He played the song from the CD. The voice, as if squeezing out breath, overlapped the pause in the strings and the air in the room trembled.
There was no doubt. It was this “Sanyamabushi” that my father had sung.
The image of my father at that time came back from the depths of my memory.
The Sanyama-bushi pierced my memory of that time. I wondered if what was happening to me was real? If so, I hope it is a daydream.

## My Father's Back

  The shutters remained closed.
Our family sat quietly around me in the center. I was staring at the Furoshiki (Japanese wrapping cloth) my mother had prepared for me. My mother was outside the circle. She sat alone looking backwards apart from us with her shoulders trembling.
“Toshio, let's go!”
One short word from my father broke the morning of May 2, 1957. Atsuko slowly crawled on her knee up to and adjusted my collar.
Suddenly I was overwhelmed by fear. I ran to the pillar, clutching and screaming. The room was filled with my crying mixed with screams.
“Toshio, stop crying!”
My father yelled, and that was the end of everything.
It took about an hour by bus from my house to Nago, but strangely enough, my memory of that time has completely slipped away. It is as if the boy's fear had erased even his memory. The curtain of memory opens only from Nago Town (now a city), the bus transfer point to Yagaji Island.
 The sweet smell of gasoline filled the bus station, and the whistles to guide buses were heard. Only the depots for Naha-bound and Ishikawa-bound buses were busy, with lines of people forming and breaking.
The leaves of the  Common garcinia trees planted in the windbreak shone as if embracing the morning sun.
My father looked at the schedule pinned above the sign “Shimabukuro Bedclothes Shop; Cheap bedclothes re-creation” and murmured, “Six forty-five.”
“Does the bus to Yagaji leave at 45 minutes? Two tickets to Yagaji, one adult and one elementary school.” My father leaned over the counter to buy the tickets.
It's always been that way. I was so small for my age that I could have been mistaken for a lower grade elementary school boy, and that day, too, my ticket was for an elementary school student.
There were only three of us, a man with a bag on his lap, my father and I, at the tin-roofed bus stop. Under the bench in the corner were four cats playing with each other. A kitten with a blackish bicolor kept jumping up and down on lying mother cat's tail.
The bus arrived just in time for departure, but only three people boarded.
A female conductor with a braided head took a pair of scissors and cut into the tickets offered by my father in a very familiar manner. My father nodded slightly to the male passenger who had got in before us and sat me in the back seat by the window.
We were on time, but the door was open for a while. I could feel the vibration of the engine under the seat. From time to time a warm breeze came in through the window.
The conductor whistled and shut the door. The driver spoke to her as he started the bus.
 “Mamoru didn't get on, was something wrong with him?”
 “Yesterday he told me there would be a funeral tomorrow.”
They were talking about the regular passengers.
The bus finally left when the clock on the ticket booth showed five to seven.
The bus kept running without any passengers getting on or off, but finally an elderly woman got on at Taira. She carried heavily bananas with multiple bunches.
The conductor helped her into the first seat on the left. “Auntie, where are you going?”
“To Yagaji. I have a newborn great-grandson. Thank God!”
“Congratulations! Auntie, be careful, put the ticket in your purse so you don't drop it.”
The bus stopped in front of Haneji Elementary School, and a male passenger who had got on with us in Nago got off and spoke to the driver.
“Okay, see you next time...”
The bus crossed Yagaji Bridge.
At the terminal bus stop on Yagaji Island, several people were waiting in line to catch the bus back to Nago.
“Take care on your way.”
The conductor called to the elderly lady who was quickly leaving the bus stop.
“Thank you.”
After a short walk, my father asked the fisherman who was mending his nets under an Indian almond tree for the way to Airakuen.
“Just go this way. After a while the road splits into two, take the right one and you will soon arrive at the main gate of Airakuen. Do you want to see someone there?”
My father thanked him, but answered his question vaguely.
It took us only fifteen minutes to reach the split the fisherman mentioned. The white one on the right was sandwiched by sugar cane fields as tall as I was. Occasionally the wind blew over the cane fields.
My father remained silent. I followed him, looking alternately at his back and his feet.
“Toshio, there are many brothers here. They are all small, but...” he said without looking at me. Toshio,
“Yes.”
I replied, although the meaning of his words was not clear to me. It was not until 14 years later that I understood the true meaning of those words.

A row of one-story houses lined up on either side, filled with the sweet scent of oleander flowers. Soon, a concrete gatepost appeared in front of us. On the right side of the gatepost was a sign that read “Okinawa Airakuen”.
 My father explained the purpose of our visit at the reception desk of the main building.
 “Ah, you are Mr. Iha, aren't you?  We heard about your visit. You must have had a hard time since early this morning. I'll go and tell everyone about you ...”
After a short wait, a middle-aged man led us to a high gray wall with rough pebbles mixed in. Inside the gate, three men were waiting for us.
“Mr. Kishimoto, please come to the consulting room at 9:00 a.m. for an examination. Then, you are expected in the office later.”
After the instructions, the clerk went back to his office.
“Nice to meet you. I am Furumi Eiichi, the chairman of resident association. This is Kishimoto Masao, the dormitory father, and this is Taba Seikichi, a teacher of the school. Let's go to the visiting room...” There were long, narrow desks and chairs arranged in two horizontal rows. The explanation to my father did not take long. When it was over, the dormitory father said, “We have been contacted by the headquarters of Airakuen. We want you to understand in advance that your son's name will be changed as of today. The reason for using the fake name is to avoid causing trouble for your relatives as well as himself, a kind of consideration... Mr. Tajiri has chosen a good name for your son.”
“I see.”
His name will be Sekiguchi Susumu. It's the name of Yamato (mainland Japan), but it's a good one.
He unfolded a piece of paper and showed it to my father. There was the name “Sekiguchi Susumu” written in calligraphy.
Please come and visit him from time to time.
My father stared at me in silence and did not try to get up from his chair.
“I know your heartache to leave him, but, now “
 Being urged again, my father finally got up and bowed deeply to him.
“Well, take care of my son, please.”
“Toshio, I will be back soon...” The last part of his sentence was too small to be heard.
From inside the gate, I watched my father walk away with his back arched.

In the consulting room, a doctor and a nurse with masks and prophylactic gowns were waiting for me.
“Come and sit here. Your new name is nice, isn't it? Susumu Sekiguchi, from now on you are Susumu Sekiguchi.”
“Ah!”
On the doctor's chest was the name plate “Tajiri Isamu”, which I saw yesterday.

## Sata Andagi (Okinawan Doughnut)

I was led to the rest home for boys and girls, located on the second floor of the block building,
“I will introduce you to all, as they will be back here at noon. I will go and get your school supplies, so wait here.”
With these words, the dorm father left the room. I sat alone in a room just above the stairs. In front of me were a rush mat and two neatly folded blankets, on top of which were a set of toiletries and my Furoshiki package.
I heard someone coming up the stairs. However, there was something strange about the sound. It was mixed with a slow metallic clank. The creaking continued for a while and then stopped. It was repeated about four times.
A person of strange appearance came up to me. I could not understand his words clearly, but I said “Hello” to him in return.
As soon as he sat down in front of me, he threw off his legs, pong, pong. His legs below the knees were artificial legs made of tin.
...Oh, no... I swallowed my breath.
His mouth was twisted, drool glistening at the corner of his upturned mouth. His almost fingerless hands were clutching a Sata Andagi (Okinawan doughnut) the size of a tennis ball.
“Did you leave home early this morning?”
I thought he had asked me that.
“Yes, I did...”
I replied with all my courage.
“I see. Could you tell me your name and where you are from?”
“From Ishikawa City. My name is Iha Toshio...”,
“Uh, Iha? That's your real name, right? Didn't you get a new name?”
“Oh, yes, I did,” I said.
“That's right. You will have to answer with your new name from now on.”
“Yes...I was told my name was Sekiguchi Susumu.”
“I see. You are Sekiguchi Susumu. ...from Ishikawa City, early in the morning.... Are you not hungry? Eat this.”
He handed me a Sata Andagi with his fingerless hand. It stayed on my palm for a while.
I could already taste the mixture of brown sugar and flour, the Okinawa doughnut that used to accompany the festive meal.
“Here, you can eat it.”
“Well... No, I'm not hungry now, so I'll eat it later.”
It was a lie. As a matter of fact, I was afraid. Nausea came from the back of my throat. I just couldn't bring the Sata Andagi to my mouth.
“I see.”
The man didn't force me to eat any further.
“You see, there is a chapel in front of the gate. This is a house for prayers. Whenever you feel pain, please visit me. I will always be there.” With these words, the man put on his artificial legs again and left the room.
I could not move an inch for a while. Sweat powered out from my neck and forehead. Then I kept asking myself.
“How dare you not eat what he kindly brought to me?” I heard my inner voice accusing myself.
“Filthy! No!”
“From today you are the same patient as he is!”
“No! “
After a while, I found myself running upstairs to the bathroom with the Sata Andagi in my hand.
The concrete toilet had an oval hole in it, and when I looked down, I could see a pale light shining in the side strip from the downstairs light fixture.
I dropped the Sata Andagi into that hole.
No, not dropped, I threw it down!
It fell down like a thread, and I felt it took a very long time, as if falling into a deep, deep, bottomless valley.
Just then, I burst into tears for no reason. Suddenly, uncontrollable sadness overwhelmed me.
You idiot! Idiot I am!
The voice of self-blame rose from under my feet.
 I ran out of the room and immediately went to the chapel.
In the front row of the silent chapel, the man was praying alone.
I threw myself to him and cried out loud.
“I threw it away! I threw it away! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!”
“What's wrong? What happened? It's okay. It's okay now. You're an honest child... Come on, let's pray together. I was just praying for my new friend.”
My sobbing was absorbed by the dimly lit chapel.
That person was Aoki Keisai, the evangelist.

Evangelist Aoki Keisai (1893-1969) was ordained as deacon in 1966. He was sent as a missionary to the lepers in Okinawa in 1927 at the age of 34 by Miss Eda Hanna Liddel, the director of the Kumamoto Kaishun Hospital. Deeply sympathized with the misery of the patients who had the same disease with him, driven out of their villages to hide into caves, he came to the conclusion that they needed a place to live in peace besides faith, and he stayed in Okinawa to find out the place for them.
By 1909, five public leprosy sanatoriums had been established on the mainland. Okinawa Prefecture, the poorest prefecture in Japan at the time, had more than three times as many leprosy patients as any other prefecture on the mainland. Nevertheless, the establishment of sanatoriums was not realized because since 1910, the authorities of Okinawa Prefecture had repeatedly promoted plans to establish sanatoriums, but whenever the proposed site came to light, local residents fiercely opposed to the plan, despite the exercise of strong public authority.
Evangelist Aoki saw the unfortunate situation of these friends in Okinawa, worked hard to get the land for them, thinking that even a piece of land would be enough if they could treat their disease without the pressure ofothers. Finally, he was able to buy 9,900 square meters of wasteland in Ufudoubaru, Yagaji Island, in the name of another person. On December 28, 1935, he forced the patients who had been wandering in vain to go to the land in Ufudoubaru, Yagaji Island, in the shadow of the night.
But the place where the patients had finally arrived was not for a peaceful life. They were repeatedly attacked by the locals, and their tents were constantly torn down. If that’s so…they decided to build a cabin. They thought that building their own hut on their own land would be protected by the police, unlike the temporary tent, but it was a futile effort in the face of the angry locals. Even the huts were thrown into the sea. Evangelist Aoki, the leader, even had his life threatened.
“Not even a sparrow will fall to the ground without the will of your Father. All we have to do is to surrender everything to the will of God.
“Find out Aoki! Kill Aoki!” The voices of the residents fly around in the shadows of the night.
“Father, forgive them.” Evangelist Aoki prayed as he hid in the Pandanus trees.
Three years later, his life's work was finally rewarded. In 1938, Okinawa Prefecture overcame the opposition of local residents and completed “Kunigami Airakuen. It was built on the wasteland purchased by Aoki and the adjacent land purchased by Okinawa MTL (Mission to Lepers - the organization for Christian mission, visitation and leprosy awareness) in the name of Rev. Hattori Danjiro.

　I met Evangelist Aoki in 1957 when he had already lost both legs and the fingers of both hands. It was as if he was carrying the heavy burden all over his body in exchange for the salvation of the lepers in Okinawa.
Evangelist Aoki and I sat side by side and prayed.
 Later, I visited the monument “Praise the Virtue of Aoki Keisai” as the only way to express my deep gratitude for that day. His haiku (Japanese poetry) is engraved on it.
 “Shells go through pain, be pearls in spring”
