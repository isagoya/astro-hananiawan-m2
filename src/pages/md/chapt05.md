## Smoke from Sakurajima

Passengers took off their shoes on the straw mat and greeted each other for spending a whole day and night next to each other by chance.

In the third-class cabin at the bottom of the ship, only a few people were relaxing. Others were anxious, saying that it was their first time going to the mainland, or loudly talking about trains, and some passengers gathered around the man spreading a map, who had been to the mainland several times.

The passengers were relieved to find out that they were Okinawa residents. However, the Okinawan dialect was not heard in the cabin. It was as if the dialect had been locked away and only an unfamiliar common language was floating around.

My body was covered with a blanket, only my face was visible. A regular engine noise was transmitted to my lying body.

Whenever the ship rocked heavily, my father’s knee, sitting cross-legged, touched my shoulder through the blanket.

My father and I did not take any of the three meals served on the ship. He repeated three times, "My son and I got seasick. Neither of us got seasick."

After refusing the food, he whispered to me. "We’re almost there. Be patient."

"The Naha Maru will soon arrive at Kagoshima Port on schedule. The ship is now in Kinko Bay. Please review the forms we have provided for you to fill out. When you get off the ship, each person must hand the form to the attendant. You will also need your passport, so please have it ready."

When the announcement was made, there was a new sense of urgency on board. Another announcement followed.

"From now on, officers will be going to your cabins for quarantine. Please wait with your quarantine papers ready."

My father grabbed my arm again. I could feel the tension in his arm.

We joined the line that led to the quarantine officer. Of course, I didn’t forget to cover my hands with the overcoat I was holding to my chest.

"You and your son, two. Do you have any fever, diarrhea, or other physical changes?"

The quarantine officer asked us, following the documents with his white-gloved hand.

"No, we are both fine," my father replied in a loud voice.

"Okay, next please." The officer said as he pumped the "quarantine" stamp on my dad’s and my papers, pong, pong. Blue ink oozed from the rounded edge.

We left the line behind us. My father smiled at me for the first time as we stepped out of his cabin, ran up to the deck and sat down.

At the port of Kagoshima, the people greeting the passengers formed a semicircle around the ramp, and those who came to greet and to disembark from the ship stretched out their necks, ran up to each other, and called each other by name.

The semicircle began to collapse. From the frayed spot, a vertical line of people continued toward Kagoshima Station.

As I walked down the ramp with my father holding the trunks in both hands, a voice from the crowd called out to us, "Hi, Iha Toshio, here I am. Hi, Iha!" A tall man in his forties greeted us.

"How do you do? I am Yamada. You must be tired. Mr. Ishigaki asked me to be your guide. Toshio, I’m glad to see you. The sea voyage must have made you tired, right?"

"It’s all right." To be honest, I was just so hungry and weak and almost losing my knees. My body still felt the vibrations from the ship’s rocking.

"Mr. Yamada, is there any place to eat?"

I was just so happy to hear it.

"It will take almost three hours by boat and bus to get to the hospital, so let’s have an early lunch. There is a cafeteria in the waiting room of the Nankai Yusen (mail boat). That would be a good place. Mr. Yamada said. It was the first time I saw natto (fermented soybeans) served with meals.

"Dad, this is rotten," I said.

Mr. Yamada, watching this exchange, laughed with his stomach in his hands.

"Toshio, this is natto, a fermented soybean food. To tell you the truth, I was surprised myself at first," he laughed as he politely explained it to me.

My father and Mr. Yamada continued to talk during their meal.

"I have the same disease as Toshio. I am a teacher, but I came to Kagoshima on a one-year sick leave. I had some problems with the treatment in Okinawa..." he said.

My father did not ask about Mr. Yamada himself. I listened to their conversation and felt my father's best considerration for Mr. Yamada.

The Nankai Yusen (ocean liner) sailed from Kagoshima Harbor to Tarumizu Harbor, crossing Kinko Bay.

"Over there is Sakurajima."

As I had assumed from textbook knowledge, the active Sakurajima volcano should have been actively spewing smoke and columns of fire. Therefore it was unexpected to see it standing still, with only the smoke hanging over its top.

It took about 35 minutes to get to Tarumizu Port.

We were told that from Tarumizu we would take a bus to "Kanoya and then change to another bus to Hoshizuka Keiaien.

"There used to be a base for the Kamikaze Corps (suicide pilots) in Kanoya. Over 1000 young men took off from this base and lost their lives in the skies over Okinawa."

My father nodded silently at Mr. Yamada’s explanation.

Kanoya City is located in the center of the Osumi Peninsula, surrounded by the Takakuma Mountains to the north and the Kimotsuki Mountains to the southeast. The Kimotsuki Plain, where Kanoya City is located, runs diagonally between these two plains, and the area around the Hansen’s Disease Sanatorium was called Airano.

The Hoshizuka Keiaien was in the middle of a field, surrounded by tall cypress trees, and very different from the small clusters of private houses with forests scattered nearby.

When we got off the bus, a straight road stretched across the farmland to the main gate, only where the cypress wall was broken.

On the way, my father stopped and picked up a small lump of earth from the field beside the road and put it in his mouth.

"The soil is soft, but surprisingly poor, isn’t it?" my father said.

"Yes, this is the Shirasu Plateau, where only sweet potatoes and rapeseed can be grown."

## Forced Repatriation

Mr. Ishigaki Yaeo, my father, and I were at the office of the sanatorium.

"Mr. Ishigaki, we are at a loss because you brought him here so suddenly. I've heard about it, but we also have to make some preparations. We've been in contact with headquarters, but we haven't come to an agreement yet..." the staff said.

"That is ridiculous. That was the matter of tacit agreement between the community association and this sanatorium, wasn't it?"

"Well, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has shown some understanding in this matter...but since Okinawa is still under U.S. military control, we must ask for instructions from the Ministry of Health and Welfare."

"It is not right to talk about procedures now. How long are you going to make us wait? That's why the children of Okinawa have no choice but to go this way." He said, sounding irritated.

"That boy escaped from Okinawa Airakuen, didn't he? There are various issues to be resolved on both sides..."

"Then you going to force him to be repatriated, aren't you?"

"I didn't say that..."

"See, he is standing right in front of you!"

A loud exchange continued at the counter of the office. On the other side of the glass windows, the staff stood up and listened.

"What's the matter? What's going on?" the petite woman shouted, breaking the circle of staff.

One of the staff at the counter told her the whole story so far. I could see her expression change as she listened to his story.

"And what are you going to do with him?" It was almost an accusatory tone.

"Well, there are some things to make contact with..."

"What kind of contact?"

"Teacher, you say so, but also the procedures..."

---Teacher? What teacher is she? I thought for a second.

"Have you thought at all about what this boy went through to get here?"

"Then, are you going to send him back to Okinawa?" she asked severely.

"Well, there are some things to do with papers and so on..."

"Papers? What kind of papers?" If necessary, I can write them. Shall I write that he needs to be treated in the sanatorium? I've just diagnosed him, as a doctor. Is that all right?"

-----She is a doctor.

The name tag on her chest read "Matsuda."

-----Oh, this lady is Dr. Matsuda Nami.

"We abandoned Okinawa during the war and in its aftermath. If you do not accept this boy now, it will be another abandonment of Okinawa!" It sounded like a scream.

When Dr. Matsuda came, the situation at the office desk changed completely.

On March 8, 1960, the door of the Hoshizuka Keiaien National Sanatorium was opened to me. Dr. Matsuda said to my father,

"Mr. Iha, thank you for all your efforts up to now. We will certainly take care of your son. There is nothing to worry about, so please leave.

My father repeatedly bowed his head to Dr. Matsuda and said, "Thank you. Thank you very much.

"Oh, I didn't hear your name."

"My name is Iha Toshio," I replied.

"Right, you are Mr. Iha Toshio. Well, Toshio, study hard here."

My father sent an urgent telegram to Okinawa Airakuen: "Keiaien safely accepted Susumu."

The early spring sun began to set over Airano after five o'clock. I watched him leave who kept looking back over and over.

"Toshio, take care of yourself."

"Thank you, Dad."

Dr. Matsuda Nami had experienced the Battle of Okinawa in World War II during her service at Okinawa Airakuen.

After the air raid on Okinawa on October 10, 1944, the leprosy sanatorium was also attacked by the U.S. military. Yagaji Island, adjacent to the Unten Port Submarine Base, and the neatly lined wards were mistaken for military facilities and subjected to particularly heavy attacks. About 1,000 bombs and rockets, 100 naval guns, 100,000 machine guns rained down on the lepers. The patients who had been burned out of their wards fled to the air-raid shelters, which were divided into five locations within the sanatorium, each with a capacity of 200 people. Dr. Matsuda also had to go around the shelters to care for these patients. The director of the sanatorium, Mr. Hayata Kou, finally foreseen that the sanatorium would be destroyed before a fierce attack by the U.S. military, decided to open the door of the sanatorium to the patients who wanted to go back to their homes.

Commander Nimitz, who had taken over Okinawa, issued Military Orders No. 115[^1] and 116[^2] on February 8, 1946. The purpose was to relocate leprosy patients displaced by the war and to prohibit access to leprosy sanitariums. Leprosy patients in Okinawa were once again forced into sanatoriums by the military leadership. Thus, in Okinawa, they experienced twice, directly and indirectly, "forced internment by the military," unlike any other in the world.

Special Proclamation No. 13[^3] was issued on February 10, 1947. The leprosy control program of the U.S. military government was now well established. In connection with this proclamation, a special proclamation[^4] was notified by the sanatorium authorities to the patients on February 19.

Clause 1 stated: "Those who escape or allow others to escape shall be punished by death."

Later, on July 5, 1949, the U.S. military government issued Special Proclamation No. 32, which withdrew Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the "Prohibited Matters" clauses of the earlier Special Proclamation No. 13.

The postwar treatment proclamation of the U.S. military government did not only affect leprosy patients. The order to forcibly evacuate all but residents of the Ryukyu Islands was issued.

Therefore, Director Hayata, Medical Director Matsuda, and Chief Nurse Nishizaki Chika, whose legal domiciles were on the mainland, had to leave Airakuen in 1948.

## Connected Route

The entrance exam for that year had been completed in January. Therefore, I had to wait in Hoshiuzuka Keiaien until next year's exam.

I lived in the boys' dormitory, which was divided into four rooms. As a result of discussions between the community association and the school, I was allowed to attend classes at Oaira Junior High School, the Hoshizuka branch, to study subjects required for the entrance exam to Oku High School: Japanese, mathematics, social studies, science, and English, which would be required after enrollment.

During the year I spent there, I was surprised by the big differences between Keiaien and Okinawa Airakuen. One of them was the clothing of the staff who provided medical treatment. I had never seen the bare skin of doctors or nurses at the sanatorium.

At Okinawa Airakuen, the medical staff were heavily equipped, wearing white caps, large masks with only the eyes showing, white coats, surgical rubber gloves, and rubber boots to deal with us. It somehow made me believe that my disease was so terrible, and the awareness always weighed heavily on me. Now there were nurses in front of me without gloves, rubber boots, or masks, but with living human faces. My medical report on the desk clearly stated my real name, Iha Toshio.

"Mr. Iha, let me take your pulse."

As her bare skin fingers took the boy's pulse, his heart pounded to the breaking point.

-----What beautiful hands.

My eyes stayed on her white fingers. Suddenly, my own male organ began to erect. I was ashamed and felt miserable, but I realized that for the first time I was becoming aware of the opposite sex.

It had been about five days since my arrival in Kagoshima.

"I have good news to tell you," Mr. Ishigaki invited me into his own room.

His house was one of a series for married couples that had the same house arrangements. The size is a six-bedroom with a kitchen, and each room has a neat flower bed in front of it. The daffodils in the flower beds seemed to float in the light coming through the glass doors.

During dinner, I was asked about the difference between Airakuen and Keiaien, and I mentioned the medical staff's uniforms first.

"I see, but it hasn't been that long since we changed the style. Let me show you something interesting," he said.

Mr. Ishigaki took out a green folder from the bookshelf. Inside were newspaper clippings and booklets, and he pointed to the page where a discolored sheet of galley paper was tucked.

"This is the 'Guidelines for Entering and Exiting Patient Residential Areas' for outsiders and staff. It is much simpler now. Some people in Japan even lie that the reason there have been no cases of infection among the sanatorium staff in the long history of Japanese leprosy sanatoriums is because they have taken such strict precautions against contact with infected people... With the verification of time, the error is gradually being corrected."

> [Guidelines for Entering and Exiting the Patient Area]
>
> Entering the Patient Area:
>
> 1. Take off your clothes in the locker room and put on monpe (old work pants for women) in the next room.
>
> 2. Put on socks and boots in the next room.
>
> 3. Put on a jacket, hat and mask in the next room.
>
> 4. After checking, enter the patient area.
>
> Exiting the Patient Area:
>
> 1. Wipe shoes with a shoe mat soaked in disinfectant.
>
> 2. Disinfect your hands.
>
> 3. Take off your jacket and hat in the next room.
>
> 4. Remove your mask in the next room.
>
> 5. Take off your socks and boots in the next room.
>
> 6. Soak your feet in disinfectant and wash your hands twice in the next room.
>
> 7. Wipe with mercury sublimate gauze in the next room.
>
> 8. Remove monpe and soak feet in Lysol liquid in the next room.
>
> 9. Bathe and change all clothes. Gargle with disinfectant.

"I suppose they still stubbornly cling to that educational attitude at Okinawa Airakuen," he said.

"I was also surprised that there were no patrols here and that I could go in and out of the sanatorium freely." I added.

At the regular movie night in the Keiaien Hall, residents from the neighborhood always fight over where to sit with the patients to watch movies side by side.

Whenever we had regular movie nights in Okinawa, they always disinfected the staff's seats beforehand.

-----Brother Susumu, I'm so happy, I'm sure we'll have a movie tonight, because I saw them disinfect the seats----- They did it so thoroughly that children knew well the connection between disinfection and movies.

"Why are they so different?" I asked.

"The people in this area are full-time farmers and not very wealthy. The sanatorium is the only place where they can get a glimpse of culture. The knowledge that leprosy is a terrible disease disappears with daily contact and time, because the wisdom of the living person is superior to the information given. I think human wisdom has overcome the walls around it. Perhaps the biggest factor is the desire to see movies for free." Mr. Ishigaki grinned at me.

I wished for such a day would come to Okinawa.

"Well, I have a good news for you today!" He had a big smile on his face.

"Toshio, your juniors are following you."

"Really?"

"It's still unofficial, but for now, the patient association has decided to accept them. Good for you!"

"When?"

"In two weeks. Three patients will be here, two of them will go to Kikuchi Keifuen in Kumamoto Prefecture, and the other will go to Oshima Seishoen in Kagawa Prefecture."

"Thank you very much. Thank you so much."

I thanked him over and over again.

The staff who argued back and forth with us at the sanatorium counter also worked hard to open the route to the higher education for the child patients in Okinawa.

There were 9 children before me and 9 children after me who came to the mainland by "escape" or personal travel. Starting in 1962, an agreement was reached with the authorities, the Mainland Sanatorium Community Association and the Airakuen Community Association to open the "tacit" route, and 13 children were sent out. This unofficial method of travel, which required many sacrifices from the child patients, finally came to an end when both the Japanese and Ryukyu governments officially agreed to the long-held dream of conducting local examinations in Okinawa beginning in 1965.

It ended in 1980 with the sending of the last child, but the number of child travelers made under this official responsibility was 38.

In order to obtain the opportunity to study, the method of traveling to the mainland changed from escape to tacit approval to public recognition, and the total number of children with leprosy from Okinawa reached 71. In fact, this number is more than 20% of the 307 graduates of Okayama Prefectural Oku High School.

Under the U.S. military regime, leprosy control in Okinawa focused on a policy of isolation. In 1958, the 7th International Leprosy Conference was held in Tokyo. Colonel Irven H. Marshall, Director of Social Welfare for the Okinawan Civil Government, who attended the conference, stated in a newspaper immediately upon his return to Okinawa that "the Leprosy Prevention Law is unnecessary," suggesting a change in medical policy regarding leprosy in Okinawa. This sudden statement was called "Marshall Sensation" and caused great shock to those involved.

The Social Problems Subcommittee of the 7th International Leprosy Conference resolved to recommend to ----- governments to abandon their policies of forced segregation where they still exist. This resolution was a direct repudiation of the leprosy medical policy of the host country, Japan.

On August 26, 1961, the Ryukyu government enacted the "Hansen's Disease Prevention Law" as its own law. It was a landmark law that clarified the "Rules for Leaving a Sanatorium or Hospital" and "Rules for Home Medical Care". However, the life of this law was only 11 years. With the return of Okinawa from the U.S. to Japan in 1972, the law also reverted to the "Japanese Leprosy Prevention Law (repealed in 1996)" and returned to the mainland, which went against the trend of the world.

## Evening Primrose

My best friend, Ryuji, was one of the Kagoshima tour group members.

"You are terrible. You just left without a word." He said as soon as we met and slapped me hard on the back.

As we settled into our room, his first news was about A., who had been my classmate until second year of junior high school. He had transferred to Yomitan Junior High School in his hometown for the new term of third year and was studying for the entrance exam to Yomitan High School. However, A. was rejected from Yomitan High School. Mr. Makabe Tokumatsu, the principal of Yomitan Junior High School, was suspicious of his failure who excelled in both academics and sports, and investigated the reason for his rejection. It was because of the certificate issued by the leprosy sanatorium, which wrote that he was "minor" instead of "cured".

At that time, a certificate was issued to those who were cured of leprosy upon their return to society, but the phrase "leaving the hospital with a mild recovery" was the reason for their rejection.

The principal, Mr. Makabe, did not leave the issue of rejection unclear. He questioned society about the high school's mishandling of the issue and asked for insights from the educational field. As a result, the "Yomitan High School Rejection Issue" became a social problem.

The "rejection" notice from Yomitan High School was not rescinded, but another private high school opened its doors to him, saying, "We welcome Mr. A. to our school.

"He must have been in shock," I said.

"I thought so and wrote a letter to A. immediately. On the contrary, he wrote me back and encouraged me saying: 'Don't worry about me. Do your best on the mainland.’"

After that, we had news that A. had been accepted to high school. Later, he was selected as a torchbearer for the Tokyo Olympics and played the lead role while still in high school.

Ryuji and I continued to study for the exams side by side at our desks. We were only allowed to attend school for the five subjects on the exam, and we took remedial classes in the back of the classroom.

Around seven o'clock in the evening, we would take a break from our studies and lie in bed looking forward to something.

It was the sound of a mandolin coming from the next room.

"Troika", "On the Shore of Lake Baikal" and "In that Far-off Land" were the first music I had ever heard. The plucking of the strings sounded tremulous. It overlapped with the sound of the sanshin (traditional Okinawan three-stringed instrument) my father used to play.

Mr. Asato Yasuhito always played the mandolin at this time. When he returned to the dormitory after working as a cook at the sanatorium, he would sit in the hallway with a twisted towel on his head and play the mandolin for nearly half an hour.

At that time, all the residents of the sanatorium received 500 yen for one month as living support. If we used it to buy books or school supplies, we would almost run out.

"Why don't you eat this during your studies?"

Sometimes Mr. Asato would visit our room and offer us sweets or other things. He bought them with the meager wages he earned working at the sanatorium.

I have another unforgettable memory of him. It must have been around the middle of August, because the Obon dance song (one of the Buddhist events) could be heard on the wind.

"Toshio, keep studying and you'll go crazy. I'll show you something nice tonight, come with me."

At dusk, I was taken to a field on the edge of the north. It looked as if it had not been used much and was covered with summer grass, except for the track.

"Come here, come. Lie down on the grass and listen carefully."

He pointed to a spot where summer grasses grew waist-high all around. At the top of the stalks were yellow buds. From the ground where we lay side by side, I could feel the lingering summer heat that had not yet fully dissipated.

"This is the evening primrose, usually called Yoimachigusa (waiting for the evening to come). When the sun sets and the moon rises, the evening primrose begins to bloom all at once."

I imitated him and lay down on the grass with my right arm on my pillow.

"This flower cries while she blooms..."

"Crying flowers?" I asked.

"Yes, they compete with each other and cry..."

I wanted to hear grasses crying.

----- rustle, rustle, rustle-----

I could hear them. It was a rustling sound, not that of the wind.

"Oh, I can hear them! The Evening Primroses are crying!"

## Notice of Rejection

On January 20, 1961, the day of examination, the winter sky was high and clear.

On the same day and at the same time, entrance examinations were held at sanatoriums in Aomori, Miyagi, Gunma, Tokyo, Shizuoka, Okayama, Kagawa, Kumamoto, and Kagoshima.

Ryuji and I left our rooms an hour early to make the 8:30 a.m. exam start time.

The Hoshizuka branch of Oaira Junior High School was located on the west side of the school, across the valley and about a 15-minute walk from the general patient area.

As we walked through the cedar grove, the frost columns made a crunching sound under our feet.

Normally, we would talk to each other on the way to and from school, but today we were silent. Just before entering the classroom, I called out to Ryuji.

"Let's do our best."

"All right," he said.

In the classroom, a total of eight students lined up with nervous faces. At 8:30 the bell rang and the examiner said.

"Now get to work on the questions. The first subject is Japanese. Don't forget to write your names first."

At his voice, we all reached out to our respective test papers.

An examiner from the Okayama Board of Education sat in the teacher's chair and looked down at us. Principal Morimoto Kazutoshi was present at all the exams and walked around us. From time to time, he would peek at the test papers we were filling out.

Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science, all the exams were over. As soon as the signal was given that it was over, Mr. Omura stood up and said playfully.

"Done! It's over! Farewell to the suffering of my youth!"

After the exam, we were called to the principal's office one by one and informally told how the exam had gone.

"Mr. Iha, you did well. Only one wrong answer in science, but the rest was fine. The principal, Mr. Morimoto, who always called Ryuji and me with "Mr." in front of our names to distinguish us from other students, called me that today as well.

"Yes, thank you," I said.

Ryuji was excited on the way home.

"We did very well, don't worry. Shall we go to Kanoya tomorrow? I heard that 'The Migratory Bird with Guitar' is being screened there".

The result of the examination was brought to us on February 20.

The principal, Mr. Morimoto, was in a state of panic in front of me. He said that all the names of the other seven students were on the acceptance letter except mine.

"That is strange. I can't believe your name isn't here... I think there must have been some mistake, and I contacted Okayama Prefecture about this"

----- Rejected? Did I fail the exam?

All at once, my whole body's strength disappeared.

I stared at the ceiling of my room. Ryuji was beside me and repeating the same words.

"Strange. It can't be. Some kind of mistake."

I traced back the possible reasons.

----- That one! That must be it! There was only one thing I could think of.

Students who wanted to take the exam had to submit a written report from the doctor in their hometown. Dr. Matsuda diagnosed me and mumbled as she filled out the form.

"You know, the high school is a boarding school, so it might be difficult for you to live among such energetic students..." She mentionded some concerns.

-----Special consideration is given to total loss of function in both hands, both wrists, left ankle drop-----

-----That one! That's all I can think of. Physical function was the problem... but that is not possible...

I thought about what the "physical reasons" could be.

Gradually, an indescribable anger welled up in my chest.

## The 31st Person to Pass the Examination

"Ok, let's ask them to explain directly! Ryuji, I will write them a letter. I need to make it clear why I was rejected. If I go on like this, I don't know what for I escapted from Okinawa.

"Who will you send it to?" he asked.

"To the Okayama Prefectural Board of Education."

Doubts and anger overflowed.

"Ryuji, could you go to the library and borrow the 'Leprosy Prevention Law' and the 'Pocket Version of the School Education Law' for me? I'll work on a draft."

"Okay. Think hard."

I rewrote the letter to the Okayama Board of Education over and over again.

> To the Okayama Prefectural Board of Education  
> Dear Sirs,
>
> Please excuse my rudeness in writing to you directly. My name is Iha Toshio who applied to Okayama Prefectural Oku High School from Kagoshima.
>
> We received the acceptance letter from you today, and I myself was rejected.
>
> Mr. Morimoto Kazutoshi, the principal of the Hoshizuka Branch of Oaira Junior High School, attended the exam on January 20, and he told me, "Iha's test results were not inferior to those of other students. I can hardly accept his failure this time.
>
> I myself am confident about the results of the test. I just cannot accept the failure this time.
>
> I heard that we contacted Oku High School directly about my rejection, but did not receive your reply.
>
> What was the purpose for the establishment of the Niirada class of Oku High School in the first place?
>
> As Japanese citizens, lepers are entitled to equal educational opportunities. Was it not to realize this concept of the Basic Education Law? To realize this spirit, you used Article 75-2 of the "School Education Law" in the new “Leprosy Prevention Law” and stipulated it as Article 14-2, didn't you? If this failure is due to the test results, I will study harder and try again next year.
>
> If this time's rejection is due to my physical functions, it is beyond my control, and there is nothing I can do about it.
>
> I really want to know the reason for the rejection.
>
> The results will allow me to clearly choose the path I should take in the future. However, if the rejection was due to the physical findings, I cannot regret it enough.
>
> I had done everything by myself, both in junior high school and in the group life of the boys' and girls' dormitories. It was the same with physical education. For physical reasons, I could not stand up to others, but I never gave up my own participation in physical education, not even once.
>
> If it is unjustified for me to study in the Niirada Class of Oku High School because of my physical condition, where should I go to study?
>
> Since the door of the school for lepers has been closed to me, which high school should I go to?
>
> Am I not the one who should go to Oku High School?
>
> Even though I am physically handicapped, I have continued to make my own way.
>
> Please do not judge me just because of my physical condition. Please examine the circumstances of my group life in the past and decide.
>
> Thank you very much.
>
> Sincerely yours,  
> January 20, 1961

It was almost midnight when I finished writing the letter.

It was ten days after I sent the letter that Mr. Morimoto, the principal, suddenly came to see me.

"Mr. Iha, you might be able to get an extra pass. I heard that you sent them a letter. They read it, and one of them from the Okayama Prefectural Board of Education is here today. He wants to see your daily life here in private. So, behave more cheerfully than usual, are you okay?"

-----Oh, they received my letter! They listened to my appeal! It was a week later. I received an acceptance letter from the Niirada Class of Oku High School. I was the 31st person to be accepted out of a maximum number of 30.

## Railway Track in the Dark

April 5, 1961, 7:30 a.m.

At Kanoya Station's freight yard, there clumped a group of eight Okayama-bound students and people who wanted to see them off. Two station employees stood across the tracks with small red flags and occasionally blew a whistle when the group swelled up.

For the students and commuters familiar with the daily scene at this station, it was unusual to see a crowd of people out of place on the platform. The distant eyes of the platform were focused on us.

I counted the blossoms of the mountain cherry trees, already in full leaf and left behind in the season. Eight new students were wrapped in an entire spring.

"The train will be arriving soon. Everyone from Keiaien, please leave the area, it's dangerous!" The station employee shouted.

Prompted by his voice, the farewell group began to make their way to the bus that had been specially prepared for them.

"All right, Toshio, take care of yourself. Don't push yourself too hard. Just be yourself".

"Mr. and Mrs. Ishigaki, I appreciate your help. I will write to you."

Mr. Ishigaki raised his hand in greeting and soon followed the line of people leaving the station precincts.

"Toshio, you can eat it later."

I hugged the package of indigo cloth Mrs. Ishigaki gave me. I could smell the seaweed and feel the slight warmth of the package on my chest.

"Thank you for the past year," I said.

"Now get on, get on." Mr. Morimoto, the director, urged us.

There was a mail coach waiting for us.

"Oh my goodness, are we mail? You know, I weigh 58 kg, so I'll need a lot of stamps." Omura said, putting his foot on the step.

"No, no. Fortunately, this is some kind of imperial train, so no fare at all." Kamishiro immediately made fun of him.

The mail coach (Oyu type 10) was about 12 meters long and three meters wide. Outside, the windows were protected by bars, and there were two entrances, one on the left side facing the direction of travel and the other at the coupling, each with a sturdy iron door. Inside, there was a wooden floor, built-in shelves on either side of the walls, and a toilet at the rear of the car.

We spread out our rush mats first.

There was a clatter of cars coupling up, and soon the train began to move.

"It is a thirty-six-hour trip to Okayama. At 11 o'clock, seven successful applicants will get on at Kumamoto Station. It's a long trip, so let's take it easy."

Principal Morimoto had already remover his shoes and rolled up the cuffs of his trousers. Eight of us who could not allowed to get on the passenger car headed to Okayama by the mail coach.

It took just over an hour to get to Shibushi Station. Principal Morimoto checked the timetable in his notebook.

"The train is scheduled to leave Shibushi at 1:00 p.m., which means another four hours. It will not be easy to wait in the coach...Well, I'll go and negotiate with the station master. I'll be right back, so stay here, okay?"

After a while, through the window, we saw him hurrying to us.

"Hey, you can get out of the car, we've got permission to go outside until noon, but the condition is that you go towards the coast without houses. And one more thing, remember, you are all supposed to act as a group. Please follow my instructions. Mr. Iha, you're the leader. You should be back here by 12:00 p.m. The lunch boxes are already loaded, so we'll take our lunch in the car.

I asked him in a whisper.

"Why don't you just distribute the lunches now and let them eat on the beach?"

"That's not good. We are told not to throw garbage outside the car."

The coast of Shibushi was divided into two by the port. The Yokose Beach in the south with few houses was a gently sloping white sand beach that continued as if embracing the Pacific Ocean.

We enjoyed chasing volleyballs or running around the beach for three hours which flew by in a blink.

"Hey, guys, let's go back," I said.

At 1:00 p.m., the mail coach was hitched to another freight car. In the clattering car, the principal opened his notebook and began to give us directions.

"Now, pay attention to me. We are going to Miyakonojo on the Shibushi Line, Miyakonojo to Yoshimatsu Station on the Kitto Line, where another lunch boxes will be loaded."

"Dinner will be a little later, around seven pm. From Yoshimatsu to Yatsushiro by the Hisatsu Line, then we will connect to the freight car of the Kagoshima Main Line and finally arrive at Kumamoto Station. We would be crossing the border between Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Kumamoto prefectures. The arrival time in Kumamoto will be eleven o’clock. Okay, guys, have you got it?"

"Completely understood, especially the time of dinner and arrival in Kumamoto!"

There was a burst of laughter in the coach.

The train moved on in the dark. We were tired, and after nine o'clock everyone lay down on the floor.

I stared out the barred window. Occasionally, lights flickered on and off in the distance. I strained my eyes, trying to read the names on the pillars of each station.

We passed "Naraguchi," "Isshōchi," and then I could see a particularly deep darkness falling on the right side of the carriage window.

Every time the train turned to the right, I could see a shining white band underneath. It appeared and disappeared again and again.

"That could be a river." I thought.

I quickly unfolded the map and looked at it.

"Naraguchi. I see. Isshōchi. Okay. That means the white strip below must be the Kuma River."

As we approached Yatsushiro Station, the outside changed from darkness to the brightness of the city.

"Hi, guys, get up. Get up! We're at Yatsushiro Station. We'll be at Kumamoto Station in about an hour."

## Because Transporting Infected Patients

At Kumamoto Station, seven students boarded the train. Three of them were girls. Among them were Shinchi, Miyara, and Kakazu. I had not seen them for a year.

We started introducing ourselves right away. When the girls introduced themselves as "I'm Matsuda," "I'm Hashimoto," and "I'm Inoue," the Kagoshima group gave them a big round of applause.

"It was only the boys who came to Kumamoto, which was almost suffocating for 15 hours. From now on, we will surely have a great and wonderful time!" We cheered at Omura's greeting.

We greeted the morning in the station yard of Moji Station. Out of the window, I saw a surprising number of trains lined up. There was so much activity there that the earth was creaking. Some trains were being pulled by a starting car and were leaving the yard in a line, while others were resting for a while. At the front of the starting car, an attendant in a work uniform waved a small flag and led the train, it looked like he was hanging from the deck.

The glass windows of the cars shone brightly in the rising sun.

But there was an empty space around our mail coach, as if we were parking alone, abandoned by others.

"Well, let's get some fresh morning air."

Omura and Kamishiro opened the connecting door and went downstairs.

"Hey, no! Hey, no! You can't get out of the coach!"

Suddenly there was the loud voice of a station guard. Omura and Kamisiro rushed into the coach and slammed the door shut.

"Damn it! How miserable! We're like prisoners. They're watching us closely."

Our mail coach stayed at Moji Station until after 3:00 p.m., then pulled out of the yard by a starting car and attached to the rear end of the passenger cars.

"For the first time, we can travel connected to people!" I was excited.

The train entered the underwater tunnel and ran through the Sanyo main line.

"The next stop will be Hiroshima. We will stop at Hiroshima for six minutes. Hiroshima! Hiroshima!"

It was just after we stopped. The connecting door was opened wildly, and the saleswomen with large wrapping cloths on their backs rushed in.

"Here empty seats are. It's okay. Come here. Excuse me, all of you."

The ladies began to unload their luggages, calling to each other.

-----beep, beep-----

From outside the car, the conductor blew his whistle and yelled loudly.

"No, you can't get in there. Get out of the coach, now!"

The women were quickly pulled out of the coach. Judging from his angry look, it was easy to guess what he was saying to them about us.

Soon there was an announcement. "This train will be delayed for five minutes." Then two station agents taped a sign to the glass window of the door ahead of the mail coach.

It read inside out, "No Entry! Because Transporting Infected Patients."

Since then, everyone fell silent until Okayama.

On the train I devoured two reports: "The Report of the International Conference of the MTL (Christian Relief and Leprosy Society)" in 1954 and the "International Conference on Relief and Social Rehabilitation of Leprosy Patients (Rome Resolution)" compiled by representatives from 51 countries including Japan in 1956.

The MTL report was discussed and summarized in response to the views of the "WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy, 1952". The composition and structure of the report was as follows.

I. Epidemiology II. Control III. Classification IV. Treatment V. Research. It was extensive and a guideline agreed upon by the international leprosy community at that time.

In particular, at the moment when I saw point Ⅱ, the control, I was struck with a shock similar to dizziness. It said: "Leprosy is not an individual disease, but a general public health problem in leprosy endemic areas. It is necessary to establish a leprosy control policy based on the principles of public health without fear or prejudice" and "It is desirable that special leprosy laws and regulations be abolished and that leprosy be legislated along the lines of other infectious diseases in the general public health regulations"

1954 was three years before I got sick, wasn't it? Leprosy is not a special disease? Special leprosy laws abolished? The report astonished me as if heaven and earth had been turned upside down.

What was it that had been crushing me all this time? What was the meaning of "My Leprosy" that had torn the heart of a 14-year-old boy to pieces?

The "Rome Resolution" sponsored by the Order of Malta was even more overwhelming.

-----Leprosy is already a curable disease and discriminatory laws must be abolished and educational activities intensified to eliminate prejudice. The policy of isolation should be corrected and treatment in community hospitals or at home and rehabilitation in the community should be recommended-----

-----What a mess! This is all the opposite of what's going on in Japan today, isn't it? ... What on earth is the reason for the humiliation we're experiencing in this car right now?

My body started shaking uncontrollably. I felt as if all my pores had opened.

This is not the story of utopia in the future! The world has been in motion for a long time.

The total distance from Shibushi to Okayama was 806 kilometers, and even in those days it took less than 20 hours. In our case, it took 36 hours, and although it was the Japanese National Railways that ran the trains, it was the medical administration under the mask of public health that arranged this special schedule for us.

Those hours I spent straddling the tracks from Kagoshima to Okayama have changed my way of thinking.

-----I will definitely punch a hole in that unforgivable wall!
