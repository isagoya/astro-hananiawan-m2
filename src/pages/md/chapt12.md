## Supplement 1 About face

I opened my PC to find an e-mail from my son. After a short greeting, there were questions about Hansen’s disease. I immediately started typing the answers into the computer.

<dl>
<dt>
Despite the fact that it is said to be a less infectious disease, why has it been used as a subject in literature or movies as if it were the representative status of terrible diseases?
</dt>
<dd>
There are several reasons. One is the religious status of Hansen’s disease.

In Japan, it first appeared in the Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan).

   > “In that year, a man came from a country called Kudara. His face and body were covered with white spots, or white leprosy. People hated his strangeness and wanted to throw him into the sea. When he said, ‘If you hate my white spots, you should not raise cattle or horses with white spots all over the country. Besides, I have a little talent for making artificial gardens. So if you let me stay and use me, it will benefit your country.’ As they heard him say so, they did not expel him. They had him build Mt. Sumi and the Kure Bridge in the southern garden. They named him Michinokonotakumi or Shikomaro” (Nihon Shoki Vol.22).

Later, when Buddhism became popular, the idea that leprosy was the result of “karma,” or retribution for evil deeds in a previous life, began to take root. Karma was considered the worst of all sins and Hansen’s disease was said to be the incurable disease and a typical example of karmic retribution. Even in Japanese folklore, it was said that if a patient was cremated, it would contaminate a 20　kilometer radius and it resulted famine.

> “If you see a person who does not accept this scripture, let him be guilty of his wrongdoing. Whether it is true or false, that person will get leprosy in this life.” (Lotus Sutra No28)
</dd>

<dt>
What was the place of Hansen’s disease in Buddhism, and what were the characteristics of the Japanese social consensus?
</dt>
<dd>
Since about 1930, Japan began to develop a great campaign “Prefectural Movement for No Leprosy” to ensure the confinement of patients. The Buddhist Federation and the Christian churches began to play a positive role as its leaders.
In the journal of the Otani School of Jodo Shinshu, one could even find such an article.

> “It does not just destroy one person. As they say, ‘If one person becomes a monk, nine generations can be reborn in heaven’; if one person is infected with leprosy, nine generations will fall into hell.”
>
> “When our school appoint our Buddhist leader and his wife as president and work for the movement with full mobilization, we should do our best with firm decision based on our faith, which is more deeply rooted than any other social effort.” (The Eradication of Hansen’s Disease and Otani Komei-kai:Dec.1931”,etc.)

 On April 5, 1996, the Otani School of Shinshu issued the following statement in response to the abolition of the “Leprosy Prevention Law” and began to examine its own history.

> “Our religious community made the mistake of developing the social conscience to support the government’s isolation policy and to make patients accept isolation as their destiny. We confess our mistakes and apologize to those involved...”
</dd>
<dt>
How does Christianity interpret this as its doctrine?
</dt>
<dd>
So does Christianity. The Bible says that Hansen’s disease appears as a work of God that He strikes. The typical example in Leviticus, which tells exactly what the priest should do, observe, and deal with the patient.

> “When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling, a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes on the skin of his body like a leprous sore, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests. The priest shall examine the sore on the skin of the body; and if the hair on the sore has turned white, and the sore appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a leprous sore. Then the priest shall examine him, and pronounce him unclean. (Leviticus: 13:2-3)
>
> “And if the priest sees that the scab has indeed spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is leprosy. When the leprous sore is on a person, then he shall be brought to the priest.”(ibid.8-9)
>
> “But when raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean. And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him to be unclean; for the raw flesh is unclean. It is leprosy.” (ibid.14-15)
>
> “Now the leper on whom the sore is, his clothes shall be torn and his head bare; and he shall cover his mustache, and cry, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’ He shall  be unclean. All the days he has the sore he shall be unclean. He is unclean, and he shall dwell alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.” (ibid.45- 46)
>
> “Now if the plague comes back and breaks out in the house, after he has taken away the stones, after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered, then the priest shall come and look; and indeed if the plague has spread in the house, it is an active leprosy in the house. It is unclean. And he shall break down the house, its stones, its timber, and all the plaster of the house, and he shall carry them outside the city to an unclean place. Moreover he who goes into the house at all while it is shut up shall be unclean until evening. And he who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes, and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.”(ibid.14:43-47)
>
> “This is the law for any leprous sore and scale, for the leprosy of　garmentand of a house, for a swelling and a scab and a bright spot, to  teach when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law of leprosy.”This is the law for any leprous sore and scale.” (ibid.54-57)

＜引用の訳が抜けている＞

According to the study by Arai Eiko, the word “leprosy” appears 55 times in the Old Testament and 13 times in the New Testament. (‘Hansen’s Disease and Christianity’ pp. 138,149; Iwanami-Shoten). The Canon law in the medieval England, Hansen’s disease patients were held funerals while they were alive and erased from their society. The status of Hansen’s disease in Christianity is said to have two meanings, “divine punishment” and “divine blessing,” but a common point is that both understand Hansen’s disease as the most terrible of all. Even though the Japan Bible Society only changed the word “leprosy” to “serious skin disease” in the Old Testament (1987) and the New Testament (1997), they have not yet made it clear that they re-examined or reflected on the interpretation of “leprosy” that their doctrine positioned, or their own shame in putting their hands in the movement of eradication through isolation.

In those contexts where Hansen’s disease sufferers had to bear severe historical burdens, it was common, both in the Western and Eastern world, to trace its cause back to the previous life and to link it to “ethics” as a reward for sinful deeds in this world. The American sociologist Susan Sontag analyzes in her writings that in the medieval world the sufferers of Hansen’s disease were considered a social text of depravity, when a certain disease was used as a metaphor for evils, the patients were to be expelled with violence.

> “In the Middle Ages, lepers were a social text that made depravity visible, an example and symbol of decadence. There is no more obvious act of punishment than to give meaning to an illness, for meaning in such a case inevitably has a strong moral overtone. When the physical cause of a serious illness is not known and no specific method of treatment is found,it tends to be tossed around by the meaning or waves of meanings. First of all, objects of deep fear such as depravity, corruption, pollution, disorder, and weakness are identified with disease. Then the disease itself becomes a metaphor. And under the name of the disease (in other words, used as a metaphor), other things are forced into the object of fear. The disease becomes an adjective”  
> (‘Disease as Metaphor’ Misuzu Shobo).

Metaphor is the expression of making an analogy. For example, you will often hear the bad way of saying, “This is the cancer of society".

What is the cure for Hansen’s disease?
</dt>
<dd>
Armauer Hansen, a Norwegian physician, identified the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae as the causative agent of leprosy in 1873. Leprosy was named after Mr. Hansen for his discovery. As the discovery was late, so was the development of a cure. Promin, the specific medicine, was developed by a German Dr. Domagk in 1935 and introduced as a remedy in Japan in 1946. It is a combination therapy (DDS・B663・Rifampicin) by oral administration, which reached the point to be completely cured in a short period of time.
</dd>

<dt>
Although the leprosy prevention law was abolished, what was the legal history of Hansen’s disease and its relationship to society?
</dt>
<dd>
On March 27, 1996, the House of Councillors passed the abolition of the Leprosy Prevention Law and finally put an end to the bad law that disregarded the human rights of patients and their families. In 1907, the Leprosy Prevention Act (Act No. 11) was first enacted. Although the law was revised over time in 1931 (Act No. 58) and in 1953 (Act No. 214), their purpose was consistent.

Originally, the Hansen’s Disease Act was a public safety measure against wandering patients. But it was drastically revised in 1931 to enforce the isolation of all Hansen’s disease patients. Japanese exclusive nationalism, which proclaimed the supremacy of the Japanese nation and justified aggression for territorial expansion against Asian countries, began to carry out the eradication of Hansen’s disease domestically under the slogans of “purity of national blood” and “ethnic cleansing. They did it thoroughly, even carrying out forced sterilization against male patients and targeting them as recessive genes. They took no less than an absolute isolation and eradication measure.

From this we can see that the Japanese measure against Hansen’s disease was pushed by making its object a measure against “patients” rather than “disease. More precisely, the object of “leprosy relief” was not the patients but the so-called “unaffected” people. This ideology led to the goal, as forced restriction of public authority, elimination of minorities, and even deprivation of personal rights in the name of social defense began to be carried out legally.

The measure for Hansen’s disease in Japan under the medical mask was carried out for 89 years even rejecting patients and their families to live together in society. Japan is the only country in the world’s medical history that continues such a medical measure to this day. In other countries, “isolationism” has been transformed into “open method therapy” through the development of specific medicine Promin in 1941. The movement was further advanced and made decisive by the International Conference MTL in 1954, the Roman Conference in 1956 and the 7th International Hansen’s Disease Academic Conference in 1957. There were at least four opportunities to change the Japanese measures against Hansen’s disease. But it did not happen in Japan.

One of the reasons is the error in the medical administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. It was their attitude to isolate and eliminate patients as the only absolute policy. In addition, the rigid bureaucracy is beginning to dedicate itself as the guardian deity of the enacted law. Even if the law has lost its medical basis or is against the current of the world.  Not that there were none among the health bureaucrats who pointed out that the “Leprosy Prevention Law” was outdated, but they were not strong enough to influence changes in medical policy. They were aware of the problems, but no bureaucrat had the insight and courage to put a bell on a cat.

Another was the role played by the Japan Leprosy Academy (now the Japan Hansen’s Disease Academy). This organization has a unique character. The mainstream, as core members, are doctors working in Hansen’s disease sanatoriums. Most of them had been burning with the idea of national purification since the time when there was no specific medicine, and they were convinced that the only way to eliminate Hansen’s disease was nothing but isolation. In particular, the influence of the group led by Kensuke Mitsuda, who was awarded the First Class Cultural Medal, was decisive. Although the clinical result of Promin was already evident in Japan, they crushed the flow of “open medical care.” Some of the ordinary medical workers and religious people were sincere with the patients, but they were nothing more than minorities in the framework of medical politics.

There is another important point. It should not be left unclear that the policy regarding Hansen’s disease has not been changed to this day, that the Japanese people have not questioned it and have approved of it as a result.

Patients were forcibly locked behind the wall and hidden from the eyes of the people. The loud cries of the stigmatized patients could not reach the people who were forced to have special feelings about Hansen’s disease, nor did they have an ear to listen to them. People were not interested in how patients were treated in sanatoriums, nor did they feel any pain for them.

Moreover, the mass media, which are supposed to “guide public opinion,” would not have ignored it, but even they made a big mistake in historical perspective. They once praised and flattered the medical administrators as “messengers of leprosy salvation, devotional deeds” who had driven the patients into such harsh situations. There was not a single point of view in their reporting attitude that considered the patients suffering from the disease.

While around the time of the abolition of the “Leprosy Prevention Law,” the mass media suddenly changed its attitude and began to report as “the law neglected human rights, the patients were forced to carry the unjustified burden of a harsh history. It was as if they had completely forgotten their own past, which had misled the social consensus.

-----And then, finally, they joined the “national confession theory” that no one is responsible. Now it is time for the mass media to try to verify history, including their own mistakes. ---Why did the medical treatment of Hansen’s disease go wrong? Who made the mistake? Who neglected it?

On March 27, 1996, the “Leprosy Prevention Law” was abolished. On April 1, the “Law on the Abolition of the Leprosy Prevention Law” was enacted.

<dt>
What was the role of the lawyers’ group and the human rights organization?
</dt>
<dd>
On January 18, 1996, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations made the following announcement.

1. The policy of the “Hansen’s Disease Prevention Law”, which has the “Leprosy Prevention Law” as its core in our country, will be drastically reformed.  
  Originally, the infectious force of Hansen’s disease is very weak, and since 1940, along with the development of effective medicine, there is no medical necessity to treat it differently from other infectious diseases, and it can be adequately treated by outpatient therapy.

1. However, the present “Leprosy Prevention Law (Rev. 1953)”, which is the core of the Hansen’s Disease Law in our country, takes over the “absolute isolationism of the old Leprosy Prevention Law” as it was, and decided to charge prefectural governors with “entering the sanatorium (Article 6), “restriction on going out of the sanatorium (Article 15) and maintaining order by the authority of the chief”. This resulted in unjustified discrimination and various serious human rights violations.  
According to the medical point of view of Hansen’s disease, these articles of the current Leprosy Prevention Law, together with Article 3-3 of the Eugenics Protection Law, which allows eugenic sterilization of Hansen’s disease patients, are highly suspected of violating the Constitution13,18,22,14,31 and the International Covenant on Human Rights Articles 7,9,10,26, etc., which guarantee the right to pursue happiness, freedom of body and movement, equality before the law, and due process of law.

3. Therefore, the Japanese government should consider the following points as a consequence of revising and abolishing the Leprosy Prevention Law this time.  
(1) For the patients who were forced to sacrifice most of their lives under the absolute isolation policy, it is a matter of course to maintain and develop the present level of their life, medical care and welfare services and to make it a permanent system with a legal basis.  
(2) To correctly investigate the false history and reality of leprosy prevention, objectively clarify when and how the mistakes were made, and officially announce them to the Japanese people. And to apply the lessons learned to the future of public health administration and never fall into the same rut again.  
(3) In order to get rid of the unreasonable medical and social discrimination and prejudice caused by the leprosy prevention policy, policies such as enlightenment or education should be strongly developed.

Despite the statement mentioning, “We should make a correct investigation of the false history and reality of leprosy prevention, objectively clarify when and how the mistakes were made, and officially announce them to the Japanese people,” there are no words about their responsibility as guardians of human rights.

On March 19, 1996, the Kyusyu Federation of Bar Associations made the following announcement.

1. …(Omitted)  
2. First of all, leprosy is the disease of which the infectious is extremely weak, sinceits special drug had been developed in the 1940s, it has been transferred to outpatient therapy throughout the world. Although there were no medical reasons to justify isolation and confinement when the current Leprosy Prevention Act was enacted (1953), the old policy of “lifelong isolation” and “sterilization” continues unchanged despite repeated international criticism. It is extremely regrettable that the current Leprosy Prevention Act, which fundamentally violates the basic human rights and dignity of individuals, has existed for so long.  
Therefore, the Japanese government should make a sincere apology to restore the honor of those involved and immediately take measures to compensate for the serious damage suffered by patients in sanatoriums and their families to this day…  
Kyusyu Federation of Bar Associations with the position to make it our mission to protect fundamental human rights and realize social justice, having the responsibility to try to improve the legal system with legal responsibility, we lawyers and bar association reflect on our mistake in allowing the existence of this law for such a long time, which tolerated significant human rights violations. In addition, we once again recognize our social responsibility and continue to make the necessary efforts regarding this problem. In addition, we are cooperating with the Japan Federation of Bar Associations to examine the legal system that broadly affects people’s human rights, such as public health administration, and are trying to make necessary suggestions from the standpoint of human rights protection without wasting time.

How did 5500 patients continue their activities?
</dt>
In 1953, when the Leprosy Prevention Law was enacted, the patients continued their protest activities for a month, but eventually the government’s original bill was approved. Then, in 1961, the National Council of Hansen’s Disease Patients (now the National Council of Hansen’s Disease Sanatorium Inmates: Zen Ryo Kyo) began its activities with the decision to “Start the Movement to Demand the Complete Revision of the Leprosy Prevention Law”. In 1995, they held the 45th Extraordinary Branch Heads’ Meeting and put forward 9 basic demands to promote the revision movement.

1. We demand that the Japanese government and the Ministry of Health and Welfare recognize that the policy of forced isolation violates basic human rights under the Constitution and provide compensation for mental, physical, and material damages.

2. We demand the preservation of 13 Hansen’s disease sanatoriums as national medical institutes and oppose any reorganization or consolidation that deprives inmates of their right of residence.

3. We demand the legal culture of the “declaration” of the former ministers of health and welfare on the national measure against Hansen’s disease, its medical, welfare and the whole.

4. We demand that the administration and necessary expenses of the sanatoriums be continued from the public treasury.

5. We demand that wages be raised to the level of the first class basic disability pension and that it be established.

6. We do not allow the forced leave of inmates and we oppose the certification of persons undergoing medical treatment.

7. We demand that those who have been rehabilitated should be allowed to return to the sanatorium.

8. We demand the legal system for outpatient treatment and home medical care.

9. We demand the continuation of support for families.

However, as this movement began to work, many arguments and fears arose among the patients. The “Leprosy Prevention Law”, which was already nominal, but when it comes to changing the name, you will be thrown out of the sanatorium and have nowhere to go. One could be deprived of one’s daily life and of the welfare that had finally gotten into one’s hands. These were the main opinions.

Hansen’s disease was classified as a special disease under a special law and forced patients into sanatoriums. Therefore, all necessary expenses were covered by the national responsibility. What will happen if the law is abolished? -----Hansen’s disease is a common illness. Therefore, the special law be abolished. No burden of public expense. The cured must leave the sanatorium----- Anxiety arises that could be said to be. On the other hand, it could not be dismissed as “absurd”. In the past, even the bureaucrat of the Ministry of Health and Welfare nonchalantly used similar reasons for not changing the “Leprosy Prevention Law.”

People whose average age is in their 70s are stuck in front of this fear. They have to make the law, which has denied them all their life and human rights, their last refuge. …What absurdity? This alone is enough for you to understand how much the measures and laws concerning Hansen’s disease are inhuman in their structure and have tormented the patients, isn’t it?

It can be seen that the content of the problems requested by patient groups has shifted downward over time. If one examines the written request to the Ministry of Health and Welfare dated February 9, 1996, the remarks made by representative members of the Ministry of Health and Welfare at the meeting of the “Review and Consideration Committee,” and the statement made by the All Patients Association on March 27, 1996, the first clause of the basic demand of the patient association states, “We demand that the Japanese government and the Ministry of Health and Welfare recognize that the policy of forced isolation violates basic human rights under the Constitution and provide compensation for mental, physical, and material damages,” has not been raised in any place of public discussion since. I kept wondering about it until the speech of the former chairman of the Central Committee of All Patients Association gave me a clue when I attended the “Memorial Meeting for the Abolition of the Prevention Law and the Enactment of a New Law” on June 4, 1996.

“If we had acted only for the sake of compensation, we could not have achieved our present daily life and welfare standards, the fulfillment of medical care and nursing”.

 In this way, the “Leprosy Prevention Law” came to an abrupt settlement without any clarification of the mistakes of the law itself or the responsibilities of the country.

<dt>
What will happen to those who remain in sanatoriums from now on?
</dt>
<dd>
   In exchange for the lives they have lived, their lives, welfare and medical care will be preserved today. The tormented people had their social role, which only they could play, but they lost it. They saw only the framework of sanatoriums and were invisible to the wide perspective of “society”. For this reason, they were unable to make accusations and take responsibility for social policy from the side of the oppressed. It is all the more regrettable to think that the Japanese social measures have unfortunately repeated their history, which could be corrected only on the basis of many sacrifices.
</dd>
<dt>
Mr. Kan, the former Minister of Health and Welfare, apologized to the representative of the patients on January 18, 1966, didn’t he?
</dt>
<dd>
Historically, apologies have different aspects. His apology was as follows.

“We, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, sincerely apologize to the patients and their families who have suffered tremendous mental and physical suffering, although Hansen’s disease was already a normal disease, only the improvements within the facilities had done, and because the review of the isolation policy was late and the law continued to exist.”

We are going to make a big mistake when we overestimate the role of a Minister of Health and Welfare. He could not have made a personal decision to comment on the change in medical policy. His comment on the “Leprosy Prevention Law” was nothing more than the summary of the bureaucracy, and the minister played his role within his administrative schedule.

 The “Leprosy Prevention Law” as a medical policy had already collapsed. Its contradiction as a social policy had reached its saturation point, and the only problem was to find the opportunity. However, the process that led to the repeal was so abrupt that this wrong law was put to an end in a system that did not pursue historical investigation and political responsibility. Where was the responsibility, what was the problem? What responsibility should be taken? It was settled down, leaving the responsibility of the country and the mistake in history unclear.

In Europe and America, the apologies are very clear. Former German President

Richard Weizsäcker said, “Those who deny the past run the risk of repeating it.” Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, in response to the passage of the Civil Liberties Act (Compensation for Wartime Incarceration, 1988), sent each of the 1.2 million Japanese Americans compensation money accompanied by letters.

“Lost years and painful memories cannot be restored by words or money once given. Nor is it possible to convey our American decision to correct our unfair treatment of Japanese Americans and to respect their human rights.  
We cannot fully correct the wrongs of our past, but we can acknowledge our injustice.  
With the enactment of this law, we make it clear that our compensation for your damages and our sincere apologies are in keeping with the ideals of freedom, equality, and justice traditionally held by all Americans. For the benefit of all citizens and the future of their families.”

One exception among the recent case studies is the perspective of the Japan Leprosy Prevention Society (now Hansen’s Disease Society) published on April 22, 1995. It is very easy to understand. It points out problems and responsibilities, and above all, it contains a sincere message to people concerned with Hansen’s disease.

“...Supported by such nationalists who regarded leprosy as a national disgrace and the social defense theory to justify isolation, we were urged to take strong measures aimed at thoroughly eliminating the source of infection from society rather than at the salvation of patients.... From an epidemiological point of view, leprosy in our country could have been said to be on its way out, regardless of isolation...even the “old law”(Article 11) …had no need to be legislated. However, the “present law” was enacted without changing the basic principle of the “old law” (1953). At that time, the effect of Promin was already obvious, and the isolation of patients was rejected internationally.  
...The Japan Leprosy Society would be required to seriously reflect on its neglect of such harshness on patients, listening to their painful cries of being torn apart from their families by forced isolation.
Additionally, since the leprosy measure is nothing more than a medical measure, it was really an irreparable and grave mistake to give priority to stirring up the fear of leprosy in order to make the growth of public opinion tolerate the forcible isolation.
</dd>

<dt>
Has the Ministry of Health and Welfare not been questioned about its administrative responsibility for enacting such a terrible law for 89 years?
</dt>
<dd>
It remains unasked. On June 15, 1996, shortly after the abolition of the “Leprosy Prevention Law”, a symposium was held sponsored by the Kyusyu Federation of Bar Associations. One of the speakers, Mr. S., an assistant manager of the AIDS Tuberculosis Infectious Diseases Division of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, said the following

   “The ‘Leprosy Prevention Law’ had been corrected and survived based on the medical knowledge of the time. It was handled administratively for each occasion, such as leaving, going out, and improving their treatment.”

It was very interesting because it came from the official in charge on a public occasion. The “Leprosy Prevention Law” had been corrected according to the medical knowledge of the time and had been handled flexibly by the administration whenever problems arose. So they had done their best in 89 years of Hansen’s disease policy. He accidentally let his truth slip out.

However, there were many deceptions in his speech. From the point of view of “medical knowledge” at that time, the effect of Promin had already been proven. Moreover, from the point of view of medical policy, the abolition of isolation policy had been demanded by the Declaration of Rome (1956) and WHO recommendations (1960,61). So his speech was not to be tolerated, no matter what kind of knowledge material of that time was looked for. If the previous policy of the Ministry of Health and Welfare was justified on the premise of medical knowledge, his willful misconduct as a public servant should rather be prosecuted. And if they did nothing despite recognizing the problems, administrative negligence, a “crime of omission,” will be the issue. He also mentioned compensation for individual patients as follows.

“As far as compensation for losses is concerned, the National Patients’ Council believes that patients should not demand money and goods individually, but that the current treatment should be maintained and continued”.

 To put it simply, they had an agreement with the National Patients’ Council. From now on, the losses suffered by the patients could not be claimed individually. The responsibility of the Ministry of Health and Welfare would not be mentioned. In return, the current level of treatment would be maintained. This is what it means.
</dd>
<dt>
Are not the legislature, the parliament, responsible?
</dt>
<dd>
Politics also has a great responsibility. The abolished “Leprosy Prevention Law” passed the House of Representatives on August 6, 1953, with the original plan agreed upon by the majority of the Liberal Party, the Reform Party and Ryokufūkai, pushing through the fierce opposition movement of patients. The opponents were the Left-Right Socialist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party and the Communist Party. After 9 additional resolutions were added in the House of Councilors, the law was enacted. Despite the addition “Hope to be revised in the near future”, they had left this bad law for 43 years.
</dd>
</dl>

Japan’s measures against Hansen’s disease are going to be buried in history. If we leave everything vague, people will repeat the same mistakes. The abolition of the “Leprosy Prevention Law” was not the last chapter of the Hansen’s disease problem in Japan, it was sounded as an overture to welcome the co-living society.
