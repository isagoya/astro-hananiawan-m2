## The First thing in the morning, Paranku

 “Rat a tat, rat a tat, rat a tat!”

Six o’clock in the morning. The sound of the paranku (small Okinawan drum) played by Ishigaki Tamotsu, a dorm brother, echoes throughout the boys’ and girls’ dormitories.

The sound of the drum is the start of every morning for the children. Then four boys’ rooms on the second floor and four girls’ rooms on the first floor will be filled with noise. Room #4 in the boy’s house, Asanori, a junior high third grader, was sleeping by the window, next to him was Teruo, an elementary first grader, next to him was me, a junior high second grader, next to me was Masakazu, an elementary second grader, Yasuo, a junior high first grader, Yoshihiro, an elementary fifth grader, and fourth graders Mitsuo and Kenyu filled the room. Mr. Nakamoto, the cook who occupied the space near the entrance, was already gone.

Asanori and I slipped out of bed first. We folded up the green mosquito net that hung over the 16-mat room. That was the job of the elders.

Whenever the lights were turned off, Masakazu always began to cry.

“Mom, I want to go home! Mom!”

Every night I did not know what to do with him for his crying. All I could do was hold him in my arms and nurse him to sleep, and then he would finally stop crying.

Last night, Masakazu had been fussy but now is fast asleep on my bed with his back turned.

“Masakazu, get up. Come on, here’s the drum. Stand up and lift your right leg.”

I started to put on him the shirt and pants I had prepared the night before, calling to him. After I finished dressing him, he did not seem to be fully awake.

Since there was no other way, I moved Masakazu on to the desk, which was about 40 centimeters long and 60 centimeters wide, and then put the bedclothes for both of us into the closet.

“Masakazu, here, take your washing things...”

I grabbed Masakazu’s sleeve and hurried to the washroom three rooms ahead of us. All this had to be done in about 15 minutes.

In the boys’ and girls’ dormitories, there lived dormitory father Kishimoto Masao, mother Minami Masako, brother Ishigaki Tamotsu and sister Shinjo Taeko, who took care of the children. There was an unwritten rule among us that children above the second year of junior high are assigned to share a room with the lower grades and take care of their daily lives. I was supposed to take care of Masakazu. I had to put a stop to Masakazu’s giggling and urged him to get out into the front yard in time for the 6:30 radio exercise. After washing their faces and hands, 24 elementary school students and 32 junior high school students (33 boys and 23 girls) spread out in the front yard.

“Good morning,” said Tamotsu’s dorm brother. “This week, Yasuo’s group is on rabbit duty. Norio’s group is on food duty. Are you okay? Let’s have a good day.”

He gave the usual confirmation before the radio exercise. This was the beginning of a day of our community life with 56 members.

 The number of rabbits kept in the air-raid shelter, left as it was after the war as a valuable source of protein, had increased to 60, and the role of the rabbit duty was to mow the weeds for their food. The children without duty were to clean the garden and each room. It was scheduled after the radio exercise until breakfast at 7:15.

 After the breakfast, the children sat at their desks with their textbooks and studied until 8:00 a.m., just before going to school.

“Time to go to school!”

Father Kishimoto’s voice echoed through the hallway, and we all headed off to the school. Hansen’s disease children studied at Sumii Elementary and Junior High School, located inside the sanatorium.

The school opened in 1951, but the plan had run into a snag because the local board of education had not approved it. However, Yara Chōbyō, the director of education for the archipelago government (former governor of Okinawa Prefecture), who was passionate about ‟educational opportunities for sick children,” went so far as to change a law to remove the obstacles to opening the school and established a school directly under government control. It was closed in 1980 when the number of sick children was reduced to zero. Today, there is only a monument on the school grounds telling the story of the school.

The marble monument under the trees at the corner of the site is inscribed with the school song.

> Hope and confidence, morning and evening.  
> The bell of the forest, ring and tell the message  
> Friends, take hands encourage each other,  
> In the rainy mornings, even in the windy nights.  
> Let’s devote ourselves to the path of learning  

Next to the school song was the bell, which rang out the time to the children. The bell was given to the school from the donation for the reconstruction of the war-damaged school during the time when Mr. Yara Chōbyō was the president of the Okinawa Teachers Association.

The total number of students who have passed through the gate since the school opened is 390 for the primary school and 424 for the junior high school. Hansen’s disease has a high risk of infection in infants, and areas with a high incidence of Hansen’s disease tend to have a high percentage of infections in children. On the contrary, the number of young patients can be a barometer of the incidence of the disease in the area.

In 1951, the number of students in Sumii Elementary and Junior High was 106. In 1986, there were 46. By 1980, the number had dropped to zero. The closure of Sumii Elementary and Junior High, with its 30-years history, also meant the end of Hansen’s disease in Okinawa Prefecture.

 At the time of my infection, it was decided that Sumii Primary and Junior High School would have a headmaster and two teachers, one of whom would have to be a qualified person for leprosy patients.

Of course, it was difficult to educate 60 children with only three teachers, including the principal. As a solution, the salary of Ms. Chikako, a patient teacher who was being treated at the sanatorium, was donated to the School Support Association and divided equally among four patient assistant teachers to joining the management of the school.

The school had one class for elementary school and two classes for junior high school as a double class.

Except for lunch time and treatment time from 2:00 p.m., we stayed at the school until about 4:00 p.m.

We had free time until 7:00 p.m., including dinner, and each of us made friends and played together. However, I had severe limb disabilities due to the aftermath, so I did not want to play outside and spent most of the time reading books borrowed from the school.

From 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. was scheduled for evening study, but Masakazu, an elementary second grader, was forced to sit at his desk, almost in tears.

 “Toshi, I’already studied in the morning, so there is nothing left to study”.

Then at 9 o’clock all the lights would be turned off, and that would be the end of the day.

Looking back, it was a really orderly day. And yet, strangely enough, I never felt cramped. Perhaps those three years had been well filled days for me.

  However, an unfathomable anxiety overtook me as I grew up in the third year of junior high.

 “What should I do from now on? How should I live?”

I slipped out of my bed and spent many nights alone on the roof.

Before long, the dorm father, Kishimoto, would come and sit with me. He just sat next to me without saying a word.

“Susumu, you can’t go to sleep, can you? May I join you? I’m also awake thinking about my families left behind in Nago.”

It went on for almost a month. That day he sat next to me with his knees in his arms as usual.

“Susumu, what did you draw for the painting lesson today?”

“The charnel house.”

“I see, the sea and the green forest are beautiful there.”

“No, I did not draw nature. I just filled the paper with the entrance to the charnel house in detail.”

“What? You should have added some of the surrounding scenery, don’t you think?”

“No, I don’t think so!”

“...Artist Taira gave us some comments on the drawing lesson, and he said, ‘I’m going to bring a lot of brightly colored crayons.’”

‟No matter how many brightly colored crayons he brings us, no one will use them!”

I replied impudently, at my best, and then began to cry. All at once I wanted to let out something indescribable that had filled my heart for so long.

“Adults don’t know what it’s like for a child to want to die.”

“You fool! Don’t be spoiled.”

Dad. Kishimoto slapped my cheek.

## Slender Hands

It was June 1958, and I was in the third grade of junior high school. Ms. Tokuda Setsuko, the Japanese teacher, entered the classroom with a flushed face.

  “Big news! Big news to tell you! Mr. Yasunari Kawabata, the author of ‘Izu no Odoriko’ (The Dancing Girl of Izu), will be here in Airakuen the day after tomorrow!”

Ms. Setsuko was a new graduate teacher who was assigned to our school at the beginning of the new school year. During classes, she would often become confused and be tearful in response to my nasty questions. I wondered what had happened to the way she looked so excited today, in contrast to her gloomy mood when she entered the classroom these days.

I had good reason to be unkind to her. In April, at the same time with her assignment to our school, all the patient assistant teachers left the school.

Only if Ms. Setsuko had not come.... My one-sided assumption grew stronger every day. It was a complete misunderstanding, but my sense of justice had urged me to do it.

 She said, “I also hear that he will be visiting our school in particular. He asked us to bring your essays to his hotel tonight, because he is eager to read your writings. So I will bring them to him.”

Mr. Kawabata Yasunari, the president of the Japan Pen Club, visiting Okinawa had been reported in all the newspapers. He requested to visit Airakuen apart from his schedules, also meet the students of Sumii Elementary and Junior High School.

On the 8th of June, I was called out of the blue to see Principal Yasuda before classes started. “Mr. Kawabata called me. He has read your essay and wants to talk to you. When I tell you his arrival, come to the teachers’ room and answer his questions clearly.

Now I do not have the essay in my hand, but as I recall, the title was ‘A Single Ear of Rice’.

 A stream, whose source is the Sumuide tribe, flows into a creek at the southern border of Airakuen. Around the creek, where the river and the sea mix, mangroves glow in clusters. Right at the broken end of the creek, was a weir and a sluice gate. It also was my favorite secret place.

As I watched the creek from the sluice gate, a single stalk with its ear of rice flows and gets caught in the edge of the weir. And it repeated, sinking and rising. I stared at the scene, and before I knew it, I found myself encouraging the single ear of rice, ‟Good luck, good luck. At the same time I remembered the faces of my father and mother. I remember the rough outline of the essay something like this.

The second period, social studies, was coming to an end. Mr. Kawabata entered the classroom, accompanied by the principal, Mr. Oyadomari, and the head nurse, Ms. Chinen.

‟You’re all studying hard, aren’t you?” he said, looking into each of their faces, his voice sounding thin and weak. He was the only one not wearing armor and wearing his own clothes.

After a while, Ms. Setsuko came saying, ‟Susumu, come to the teacher’s room. Answer him clearly if he asks you something.” She repeated what the headmaster had told me, but I did not answer.

‟Excuse me, this is Sekiguchi,”

I stood still at the entrance of the teacher’s room.

‟Oh, you are Sekiguchi Susumu. Come in and have your seat there,” Mr. Kawabata said.

Mr. Kawabata’s eyes were large and his cheekbones were high. His voice, like the common language that came from the radio, sounded high-pitched.

‟Your essay was very good.”

He asked me several questions about my essay.

‟You like mangroves, right?”

‟ Yes, they grow well in both fresh and salt water. When I feel weak, I go to see the mangrove forests. Sometimes the mangrove forest shines for a short moment. But I can’t tell it, not even to you‟.

‟It’s your secret.” He snickered. ‟Do you like books?”

‟Yes.”

‟Have you read ‘The First Night of Life’? by Hojo Tamio?”

‟Yes.”

‟I’d like to hear your impressions on it by all means” he said, pulling up his chair.

‟But it was too difficult for me to understand the whole of it. I could make some sense of it when I read Tamio’s letter in the epilogue. But... Tamio’s letter is sad.”

‟I see. Which part is that?” he asked me again.

‟He wrote, ‘To live or to die, this problem was important to me. That was a fundamental question for me, rather than literature. The attitude toward life came next. If you can believe in man, you can endure to live. To believe in man or not.’” These passages, which I had transcribed over and over again in my diary, came out of my mouth easily.

Mr. Kawabata listened to me with tearful eyes and nodded his head. Then he reached out his slender hands and squeezed mine. But for some reason, I tried to pull my hands away.

‟You know what he means,” he said. ‟You know the sadness of Tamio, of ‘The First Night of Life.’”

He tapped my knee with his veined hand. ‟Write a lot. Store a lot within yourself”, he said.

‟Mr. Kawabata, it is time for you to leave,” the director urged him.

‟I see. We had a good talk today. Thank you... Sekiguchi, is there anything you want?”

‟Books!” I answered him in a loud voice.

Four weeks later, I received many cardboard boxes that were full of books.

## Visiting Day

Sunday breakfast was one of my favorite times there.

Four slices of bread for each and free refills of coffee from a commercial use kettle, and a can of condensed milk was delivered for each room.

Newspapers were spread out in the middle of the room, and the children sat in a circle. Only on Sundays we were allowed to have breakfast in our own room.

Two slices of bread were placed in front of each one, then the condensed milk was poured in swirls on the bread from the youngest to the oldest. The older children took the part. All eyes were on them at once, no one said a word.

‟Let’s eat!”

As if we had been waiting for the call of the eldest one, everyone reached out their hands to take another two slices of bread from the center and placed them on the top.

‟It’s delicious!” Teruo, a first grader, smiled broadly, his knees covered with milk.

‟Teruo, hold it with your both hands. Look, the milk is dripping. Your pants are getting wet.”

I looked forward to Sundays every two weeks. Around 10 o’clock, I waited impatiently for the call from the office. ‟Susumu, you have a visitor. Go to the visiting room.” When I hear Dad. Kishimoto’s voice, I ran out of my room.

The visiting room was within the walls of the sanatorium, a 24-square-meter building with red tiles on the roof.

My father and mother were sitting behind a long desk attached to the wall.

‟Toshio, how are you? Is anything wrong with you?”

Every time my mother began our visiting day with this question. Then she would take my hands and hold them close to her chest. My father always said the same words.

‟Toshio, are you getting along well with others? Do you follow the advice of your dorm father?”

‟Yes.”

To arrive Airakuen at that time, they had to leave their home early in the morning. They made their way as if going out in secret, people called out to them.

‟Haisai (Good morning), Iha nuyachii (Father Iha). Tai Uchisuruthi Mankaimensega (Where are you going together)?”

‟Yanbaru Madhi (To the north).”

They never said, ‟To the Hansen’s disease sanatorium,” but it was well known in the neighborhood where they were going.

‟Chimugurusanyaa! (What a pity) Today they are going to visit their son again in Airakuen.

Tempura and sweets were already laid out on the long table in the visitors’ room.

‟Toshio, now, eat them. Here is enough for you to share with others later”

My mother would just sob and sob.

‟What a pity, for this little child…”

I had some nasty words for a mother like that.‟I don’t like it. I don’t want you to visit me. All you do is sob and sob. I’m the one who wants to cry! You came here to cheer me up, didn’t you?”

Later, I preferred that my father visit me alone.

Then my mother visited me rarely, my father came by himself more often.

## Torrent of my Soul

Summer vacation was coming.

In the schoolyard, Principal Higa Yoshiyuki was taking apart the engine he had removed from his car.

‟In a four-cylinder engine, this piston compresses air and gasoline, which causes repeated explosions. This is the spark plug”, he told us.

Mr. Yoshiyuki always presented real objects in his lessons. He taught us about the structure of the engine, vaporization and explosion, and how energy is transferred. I can still remember what he told us, so it must have been a very easy lesson to understand.

‟Come on, let’s reconstruct it!” He urged the students.

Seisuke, who always funny was playful.

‟ I think the teacher’s engine is worn out, so he’s using the class as an excuse to get us to clean it, isn’t he?” he said.

 ‟You’re right, Seisuke. Don’t be a silly boy and forget the screw.”

Putting the engine back together and turned the kye, it started well.

-----Vroom-vroom-----

The body had several holes, and large holes were covered with sheet metal. The rotation of the engine was transferred to the body.

‟Moved! Moved!”

We shouted in excitement when Mr. Yoshiyuki said.

‟Be quiet. We’re going camping during the summer vacation. August 18th.”

We all cheered again.

At the beach on the northern outskirts of Airakuen, the children were excited all the morning. Bathing in the ocean, playing games, and eating outside was all new to them.

As the sun set, everyone held hands around the blazing campfire and sang the dormitory song.

> In the flower garden of a small island,  
> High hopes of innocent children  
> Can not be wrapped up in small bodies  
> Children of the wind, children of the rain, children of the light,  
> Sing, boys and girls of the dormitory.

As we finish singing the third verse, Dad Kishimoto called us to sit down with a loud voice.

‟Today I introduce a wonderful person to you all. This is Mr. S., a senior student. He is a sophomore at Oku High School in Okayama Prefecture on the mainland. He is back in Okinawa for his summer vacation, so I asked him to come here and talk to you all. Please be quiet and listen to him.”

Mr. S. took off his school cap and tucked it under his armpit and began to talk. Every word out of his mouth was like lightning to me.

-----Naichi (Mainland)! Okayama Prefecture! High School for Hansen’s disease patients! Oku High School, Niirada Class! His face looked sparkling and shining.

He closed his speech saying, ‟I am waiting for you.”

From then on, Oku High School became my main concern. I went to the library, took out newspapers and magazines, and transcribed articles about it. In the office of the community association, I read the publications of sanatoriums on the mainland one by one.

I caught Dad Kishimoto or Mr. Tokuda, the head of the community association, and bombarded them with questions.

‟How can I take the entrance exam for Oku High School?”

I became obsessed with Oku High School in Okayama Prefecture as if I had a fever. And then I finally understood something.

-----The minimum requirement to take the entrance exam was to be enrolled in a sanatorium on the mainland, and there was no way to do that in Okinawa. First of all, I had to go to the mainland. To go to the mainland, passport was required.

Since then, I have visited Mr. Tokuda over and over again.

He said, ‟I feel sorry for you, Sekiguchi, but unfortunately there is nothing we can do at the moment. You see, Okinawa is under U.S. administration. And there are obstacles such as the Immigration Control Ordinance, big walls like the Immigration Control Law, the Quarantine Law, and the Leprosy Prevention Law. It is difficult for leprosy patients to get out of Airakuen, let alone it is almost impossible for us to cross over from Okinawa to the mainland...”

 No matter how many times I asked him, his answer was always the same. That day I listened to him with slumped shoulders.

‟Sekiguchi, you want to go to high school so badly, right? Okay, then I’ll give you some good advice. Remember, I’m just talking this to myself, okay? The obstacle to your dream of going to the mainland is the law. If you follow the law and it becomes an obstacle, then you have to break the law. To be unlawful is another wisdom of man.” He laughed “wah-har-har”

I was at a loss to understand the meaning of what Chairman Tokuda told me, because it sounded so complicated.

 ‟Listen, Sekiguchi, if being a leper is an obstacle, why don’t you stop being a Hansen’s disease patient for a while? If you are labeled as Hansen’s disease patient by staying in the Hansen’s disease sanatorium, why not escape from Airakuen?”

‟Escape! Escape from Airakuen. I see!”

‟We are the same Japanese. It is ridiculous that the way to take the examination is closed for you just because you live in Okinawa. We will do our best. Your dream sure will come true. First of all, improve your academic skills and prepare for the coming time.

 ‟Yes.”

The next day I visited Evangelist Aoki after a long time.

‟Please give me the remains of the candles used for the prayer time. Don’t throw them away from now on and give them all to me.”

I melted the candle wax into an empty can. Then I added a wick to get ready my lamp. The desk was an empty cardboard box of sōmen (Japanese thin wheat noodles).

 After the lights went out, the lower part of the closet, emptied of bedding, became my study. It was the best of the best. But the closet door had to be closed to keep the light out. So my face was blackened with soot ever since I started studying in the special room.

## Scorebrand Memorial Hill

At the beginning of the second semester, I wrote a letter. Unusually, I wrote my mother to visit me by herself. I had decided to tell my mother first. If I told my father first, and he objected, there was no way to reverse the decision. Therefore it was my secret intention to avoid predictable dangers by going through my mother.

 That Sunday I took my mother to Scorebrand Park instead of the visiting room.

I did not want anyone to hear our conversation.

 Scorebrand Park is located in the center of the sanatorium and is built around a small hill about 30 meters high. Scorebrand is a personal name. Dr. Rolf von Scorebrand served as Director of Public Health for the U.S. Military Government from 1949 to 1952.

He had many accomplishments. Specially mentioned were contributing to the reconstruction of the sanatorium after the war and opened the way to secure 3,000 Kcal of food per day for the patients, which was needed for the Hansen’s disease patients in the special remedy with pro-min.

 At the top of the hill is the ‟Bell of Confidence and Hope,” a gift from the Neukorn Ironworks in Germany through his efforts. The bell is huge, weighing 1,400 kg, and it tells the time in the morning, at noon, in the evening, and in the meeting hours of the church.

 In appreciation of his efforts, the patients named the entire hill with the bell tower ‟Scorebrand Park” and take care of the park.

 Dr. Scorebrand spent the rest of his life in Okinawa and his ashes are kept in the ossuary of the sanatorium with other patients, according to his will.

 We walked through the flower beds, climbed up the 20 or so steps, and another winding 30 steps brought us to the top of the park.

We sat down side by side on a bench.

‟It is unusual of you, Toshio, to ask me to come here alone. Therefore I won’t cry today. It’s a beautiful view here,” she looked around through the grove of pine trees.

‟Kouri Island looks so close from here...” As usual, my mother spread the feast she had prepared for me.

I had been hesitating how to broach the subject...At last I made up my mind.

‟I will graduate from junior high school next March, and since Airakuen doesn’t offer any education beyond that, I want to study, but I can’t keep up. I want to learn more and more. In Yamato (mainland), there is a high school in Okayama Prefecture where sick people like me can study. After I graduate from junior high school, I want to go to Yamato! Mom, please ask Dad!”

My mother swallowed her words and did not answer me.

‟Please, let me go to Yamato!”

Her words a few minutes ago were fragile and broken. She began to cry again.

‟Airakuen is far enough for us, and yet you want to go further. No. Oh, no.”

I was desperate too. It was the first time I cried in front of my mother.

‟Please allow me to study some more. If I continue like this, I will be ruined…”

The first attempt to persuade her failed.

Afterwards my father came to visit me, but he never mentioned Yamato.

I thought, my mother did not tell it to my father, after all.

## School for Seven Students

Graduation was approaching. But I became impatient because my plan to go to Yamato was not progressing.

Out of 8 classmates (3 boys and 5 girls), none of them were expected to recover from their illnesses and prospect to leave the sanatorium. There was a mood of giving up among them.

 At the class meeting, I made an appeal. ‟If things continue as they are, when we graduate from junior high school, we will all have to go to the youth and virgin dormitories. However, there is no environment where you can study in both dormitories. Now, I have a suggestion for you. How about staying here in this boys’ and girls’ dormitory for another one year as a time limit, and figure out the way to continue your study?”

‟I agree with you!”

Seven students agreed, except for Hatsue.

‟It’s enough for me. I don’t like studying.”

Only Hatsue left the group.

And then we got serious. First, we stormed into the teacher’s room and asked for a favor.

‟Please let us continue to study in this school, even in a corner of the classroom will do,” we said.

 ‟That is impossible. The School Education Law does not allow such a special exception.”

‟Then let us stay here for retention due to poor performance.”

We could not make any breakthrough in the negotiations with the school. Then we turned to Dad Kishimoto and Mom Minami to persuade them.

‟Please help us find a way to continue our studies. Let us stay in the dormitory for another one more year, with a time limit of one year,” we pleaded.

‟All right, we will help you with your negotiation.”

Finally, a powerful ally came to our aid. The negotiating team, made up of the seven students and the parents of the dormitory, spoke repeatedly with the residents’ association.

Just before the graduation ceremony, the ‟Okay” was given.

‟Hurrah!”

The seven students took each other’s hands and rejoiced.

The president of the residents’ association announced with a big smile on his face.

‟The seven students will be allowed to stay in the dormitory for another one year after the graduation. They can use the vacant room in Section One. We have asked Mr. Denda and Mr. Kinjo to take care of you as teachers. Good luck!”

 Even the teachers, chosen from among the patients, were prepared for us. Thus, for the first time since the founding of the sanatorium, a ‟preparatory school” was opened.

We called it the ‟School for Seven Students”.

 This was the beginning of the appeal ‟Give Opportunities to Study for the Children of Okinawa,” which first moved Okinawan patients living in sanatoriums on the mainland to take action.

However, contrary to our expectations, progress was slow.

 In December 1959, when I was still a member of the School for the Seven Students, I appealed directly to my father about going to the mainland.

‟Toshio, do you really want to study so much? I’ve heard about it from Mom. Okay.

You have my permission. Summarize what kind of preparation is needed.”

  I felt my shoulders relax.

In January 1960, Dad Kishimoto called me into the dining room of the sanatorium.

 ‟I have made contact with Mr. Ishigaki of Hoshizuka Keiaien in Kagoshima Prefecture. Susumu, you can run away. But don’t tell anyone, okay?”

He has been worried about the after-effects of my limbs for a long time.

‟How I wish you could study on the mainland, Susumu. But I’m afraid that your illness with your limping hands might be known before you get on the ship!”

  But Dad Kishimoto was a little different than usual that day.

‟Do you bet?”

‟Yes, I’ll run away!”

All the blood in my body was making noise.
