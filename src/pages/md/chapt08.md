## Our Pledge

In March 1969, the buds of the cherry blossom avenue began to change color.

“Mr. Iha, are you free tomorrow? I'm sorry to rush you, but I need your help to proofread the conference program. Can you come with me to the printing office in Nakano Ward?”

 Mr. Yabe Hiroaki, former secretary general of the Tokyo Nursery School Labor Union (now director general of the Japan Elderly Welfare Problem Research Society), approached me. I met him at the Japanese Association for the Study of Issues of Persons with Disabilities, and we were close friends visiting each other. After finishing proofreading, Mr. Yabe led me on a tour of the Tokyo Colony work area. At the entrance to the two-story block building factory were signs lined up that read “Tokyo Colony Corporate Headquarters” and “Secretariat of the National Association of Colonies for Social Welfare”

I stopped in front of the frame hanging on the wall and turned discolored.

   Our Pledge

(Pioneer Road)

1. We are the pioneers who open roads where no one has dared to go.

  (Joy of Work)

2. We feel that life is worth living when we work hard against adversity rather than spend in comfort and receive pity.

    (Infinite Possibilities)

3. We believe in infinite possibilities and continue to strive to develop new skills, even when something is inferior to others.

    (Solidarity & Cooperation)

4. We encourage each other and build happiness through unwavering solidarity and cooperation.

    (Right to Life)

5. We all work together to realize a society in which all people can live as humanely as possible.

“What is this, Mr. Yabe?”

“Oh, this is the policy of the National Colony Association, which has its office here.” I heard that they formulated it in 1967 after a long discussion. Their policy consists of the introduction and 'Our Pledge'.

 “Could you wait a little while for me to write them down?”

 On the train home I read ‘Our Pledge’ several times. I could feel the human dream, hope and fighting spirit in every single word.

“Mr. Yabe, what kind of place is Tokyo Colony?”

“It is a social welfare facility, a kind of vocational rehabilitation facility called 'Jusan.'*1 It provides knowledge and skills to prepare someone for a specific job. It is the only social welfare institution that is involved in economic activities. At the time of its establishment, when people recovering from tuberculosis wanted to work in society, they were not readily accepted, so they created their own workplaces to become socially independent by acquiring skills and earning money. Now it is mainly for people recovering from tuberculosis, but I heard that they plan to open a facility for the physically handicapped in two years.

 “They looked healthy to me.”

“Yes, they are. In fact, most of them are tuberculosis survivors, and many have small lung capacities. My sister has worked there since the institution began. It was founded in 1949, and recently they finally got official help. They can get by a little easier, but they still seem to have a hard time.

“Mr. Yabe, could you please tell me more about Tokyo Colony?”

 “In 1949, there were no conditions in society to accommodate tuberculosis survivors. The survivors of the National Nakano Sanatorium in Nakano Ward began to build their facilities from vehicles disposed by the Japanese National Railways.

This was the beginning of the Tokyo Colony. Then, in 1961, ten facilities that shared the same purpose and principle came together as the National Colony Association (now “Zencolo”, 12 corporate members) and have been working on employment issues for people with disabilities.

 “I would like to see the detailed records of the colony. Do you think you can get them?”

 “Okay, I'll ask my sister.”

 Two days later I received the “Monthly National Colony” file.

My eyes were glued to the message written by Chairman Nomura Minoru for the first issue in February 1961.

“This association was born as an organization for nationwide communication and cooperation among those who struggle with the difficulties of returning to society, not only for themselves, but also for the sake of others who suffer from the same illnesses and get stuck.

What narrows their paths? We all know that there are many problems and

 none of them is small. Not only we, but also officials, scientists, doctors and

 social workers understand it. Although some measures have been taken, albeit

in a meager and crude way, there are still a number of tuberculosis survivors

who are in trouble, suffering from the burden of their lives and worried about

tomorrow's relapse.

The problem is too big, too complicated, too inaccessible. This is the voice

of the public. But those who cannot stand idly by, those who feel it in their own

skin, have no choice but to stand up. Here are two different approaches to the

problem, one from the outside, the other from the inside…”

I also found that in the National Colony Monthly Report No. 5, August, Chairman Nomura shed light on the dream I had been searching for.

      “We are in high spirits for the upcoming Tuberculosis Prevention Week at

  the end of October, when we will organize a meeting of the Tuberculosis

  Colonies scattered throughout the country. We are very small and poor in

numbers and skills. There are less than 15, including those in the planning

  stage. The total number of cured people in the colony is 250 to 260.

It would not be worth the buzzing of a bee to the eyes of politicians or

businessmen. Even the word in high spirit might be common only among us.

However, a preparatory meeting was held at the end of July, and a total of

   10 institutions had gathered, some from as far away as Yamagata, Fukuoka,

   Kumamoto, Yamaguchi, Nagano and Kanagawa prefectures. I told them, “This may be the first attempt in the world, let alone in Japan.”

  It had no significance because of its novelty. Each attempt began under

     uncontrollable circumstances with empty hands and from nothing with the   spirit, “Who can do this but us? It was born before any law was in place, and it has been the impetus for the enactment of laws.

Every social need begins in private hands. These are the general rules of the business world.

   For that reason I expect. I expect a lot. Not because I have any influential background, such as political, ideological or social. It is just to win without fighting. That is why I expect it.

I think Tokugawa Ieyasu (Japan's first general in the Edo period) must have

felt the same when he considered which side to take in the stone battle on the bank of the Abeno River. People are strong when they are weak and can live most purely when they are the fewest...”

 Examined in the relationship between the social welfare policies of the time, the Council for the Employment of the Physically Handicapped finally reported its measures on “Promoting Employment of Persons with Severe Physical Disabilities, Cured of Tuberculosis, and Mentally Retarded” only in May of that year, and it was surprising that the statements of Chairman Nomura were full of foresight so much.

Mr. Nomura’s argument sounded like a voice from heaven. I felt an electric current running through my body.

----- I didn't know that. There have been people who have started to walk on their own. Even though there is a difference between tuberculosis and Hansen's disease, I do not have to fight all by myself. Tokyo Colony, this is the place I have been looking for!

*1 Social welfare facilities, 'jusan', provide necessary vocational training or a place to work for people who have difficulty being employed by ordinary companies due to disabilities or living conditions. Commonly known as social employment centers, or SELPs, they are established and operated in accordance with the Social Welfare Services Law, the Public Assistance Law, the Welfare Law for Persons with Physical Disabilities, the Welfare Law for the Mentally Disabled, and the Mental Health Law. Currently, there are about 1200 facilities with more than 50,000 users.

## Blue Partition

I visited the Tokyo Colony on March 28.

I was taken to the office, a room the size of eight tatami mats divided by a partition of blue cloth. In the room on the left, two ladies sat at their desks doing office work. In the inner room there was a sofa with its springs sticking out.

“How do you do? My name is Iha. I want to work here and came to talk to you. How do I get to work here?”

The man, who introduced himself as a case worker, looked surprised at my sudden broaching of the subject.

“Where do you live?”

“I'm staying at Tama Zenshoen in Higashi Murayama Ward for now. But I have permission to leave, so I can leave the facility at any time.”

“Tama Zenshoen? Is that for Hansen's disease patients? Then you have had the disease, haven't you?

“Yes, I have. But I've completely recovered. I've just got the permission to leave the facility.”

“Have you talked to the welfare office?”

“No, I haven't.”

“Oh no. Please contact the welfare office of your jurisdiction first...without their introduction paper...your coming in person causes a little trouble...”

“I'm sorry to bother you. As Mr. Yabe suggested me to, and so on...”

 “Mr. Yabe, our stuff?”

 “No, his younger brother.”

 “I see. This facility is mainly used by people recovering from tuberculosis. Therefore, we cannot accept people recovering from Hansen's disease like you. Do you know what kind of institution this is?”

“Yes, I heard that you are teaching us how to work here.”

“You know, when it comes to learning a technique, each person has his or her own aptitude. Do you know what kind of work we do here?”

“Yes. I heard that it is the printing industry. I like to read books.”

 “Love of books and work are not related, and even if you could get in here, you would only have a small allowance during the training period.”

 “I don't care about that.”

 “Where will you live after you leave Tama Zenshoen?”

 “Well, is there a dormitory here?”

 “Well, we have one, but there are no rooms available now.”

 His eyes, looking into me over the top of his glasses, were look of rejection.

 “Besides, I find your hands seriously impaired - it would be impossible to work here with your hands.”

“Anything will do. Is there a way to make it possible?

“After training, the colony only accepts those who can support themselves as engineers.”

 “I will do my best. Could you help me anyway?”

“Your enthusiasm impresses me, but I'm sorry to say that it's impossible for Tokyo Colony at the moment. We are planning to open a new facility for the handicapped in two years, so you will be able to visit us again then. I'm sorry, but I have other plans. Thank you for coming from so far away. I wish you good luck.”

 The interview had ended in obvious failure.

 “Thank you very much.”

-----I knew it was impossible…

 I was overcome with an indescribable feeling of despair. I left the office and walked toward Egota Station on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line. After about a hundred meters, someone shouted from behind me.

 “Hi, Mr. Iha! Mr. Iha! Wait for me!”

 I looked back and saw a middle-aged woman running after me, out of breath. She was still panting when she caught up with me.

 “I'm sorry, but I was in the next room and heard you talking. Such a terrible dealing with you. Don't be disappointed.

Unfortunately, the director, Mr. Shirabe, is out of the office today. I'll do my best to let you see Mr. Shirabe. So don't be depressed and cheer up. Are you okay?”

Her eyes were filled with tears.

“May I give you a call to Zenshoen?”

 “Sure, but you cannot talk with me directly. Please tell my name.”

 “Give me the phone number. I will arrange for him to call you.”

 “Thank you very much.”

On March 25, 1995, I was asked to give a speech at the “Memorial Meeting for Shirabe Yosie” and I spoke about my encounter that day.

“Dear Auntie, are you running as hard as you can now in heaven? Aren't you out of breath from running? Are you doing well with only one lung with a capacity of 680? Don't you feel any more pain? That's so good. Twenty-six years ago, Tokyo Colony was poor, the office was shabby, and only a screen separated the room. So you could hear our interview from beginning to end. If the building had been fine, with concrete construction like today, and the interview room had been isolated, our conversation wouldn't have reached Auntie's ears. And if you hadn't run after me then, I wouldn't be who I am now.

## Workplace Discussion

It was shortly after my return from Tokyo Colony to Zenshoen. The announcement in the sanatorium called my name.

“Mr. Iha, you have a call. Pick up the nearest telephone. It's an outside line.”

I hurried to the phone in the office of the sanatorium.

“Hello, thank you for waiting. This is Iha.”

 “Hello, Mr. Iha? This is Shirabe from Tokyo Colony. Could you visit us tomorrow at ten in the morning?”

“Yes, I will. Tomorrow, ten o'clock in the morning. I will certainly come.”

 I visited the colony again.

 “I heard that we were rude to you. The clerk did not mean to hurt you, so please forgive us.”

 Mr. Shirabe Kazuoki, the manager, took my hands in greeting.

 “Good morning. Welcome.”

The lady who ran after me yesterday offered me some tea with a smile on her face.

 “This is my wife.”

----- I see. She is Mrs. Shirabe.

 “Thank you for yesterday.”

 I stood up quickly and bowed my head.

“Good for you.”

 “Yes...”

 “To get right to the point, do you have a favorite type of job?”

 “This is the first time I have a job, so I have no idea what kind of job will suit me. If you all see with your eyes what will be good for me and decide it, I will do anything.”

 “Well, can you show me your hands? Hold my hands. Wow, you're strong. Could you write your name and address on the paper?

 I wrote my name and address on the paper.

  1-1-4 Chome Aoba-cho Murayama Ward Tokyo

  National Sanitarium Tama Zenshoen

  Iha Toshio

 “You are good with hands. You write much better than I do.”

 Mr. Shirabe picked up a telephone.

 “Ms. Mori? Could you come down to the office for a moment?”

“May I come in?” After a while, a tall lady entered the room.

 “Let me introduce you to this young man, Mr. Iha.”

 “My name is Ms. Mori, the head of the typing department.” She sat down next to me.

 “Do you have any typewriters now?”

 “Yes, I have one.”

 “Good. How do you feel about him typing with the condition of his hands?”

 “May I see your hands? “

 Ms. Mori took my hands close to her and examined their functions.

 “Can you bend your wrists down? All right. Good. Then try to hold my thumb. You have more strength than I expected. There is no problem with these functions remaining this much.”

 “Thank you very much. I'll call you later.”

“Mr. Iha. I heard that you've told yourself that you are recovering from Hansen's disease.”

 “Yes, I have. I would like to have a job without hiding the fact that I have recovered from Hansen's disease as much as possible.”

 “I see.  I myself suffered from tuberculosis for a long time, so I think I have medical knowledge. A few days ago, I visited the Ministry of Health and Welfare and saw that they were mobilizing the guards to provide a formidable security presence against the Hansen's disease patients' appeal movement. An official in charge ordered the guards, “Do not let them take a single step here. I was angry at the attitude of the authorities. We have to stop this nonsense as soon as possible...”

 “Yes.”

“Mr. Iha, would you like to try your best here?”

 “Yes, I'd like to. Thank you very much.”

 “However, I believe that 47 fellow workers in this colony also have the same perception of Hansen's disease as the rest of society. Since I am accepting you here, I will try to have the workplace discussion with all of them. It will take some time; I wonder if you can wait until then?”

 “I will wait.”

“From now on we will be tested. I will do my best, so hang in there, you too.”

The manager squeezed my hands again.

As soon as I got back to the sanatorium, I went to see Ms. Sato, the clerk.

 “I am terribly sorry, but could you please refuse the hospital office job that Dr. Hazama introduced me to? It's been decided that I will learn a job at Tokyo Colony. Thank you for your time. I am very sorry.”

 “What just happened out of the blue? The hospital is expecting you to come from next Monday and has prepared your dormitory room. That's a problem.”

 “I'm very sorry, I know I'm being selfish, but...

 “Mr. Iha, you know that you are not able to get a salary-like income at the vocational school... How will you live from now on? You'll have to go on welfare for a while. Would you be okay with that?”

 I had no choice but to explain my idea. Mrs. Sato listened to me, sometimes sighing.

“I understand. Then your will is unwavering, is it?”

“Yes, it is. Thank you for your consideration.”

“Anyway, I have never heard of such a case... even though I have been a case worker for a long time, it is unthinkable to make it clear that you have recovered from Hansen's disease and are going out into social life. I've been on the phone with Mr. Shirabe from Tokyo Colony. He eagerly asked me and our doctor to attend their workplace discussion next week. He said they need a professional opinion.

 “Oh, I see. Thank you very much.”

Finally, admission to Tokyo Colony was put on hold for the next two months. During this time, three thorough discussions were held in the workplace.

 It is said that at first most of the workers' reactions came from the confusion of not knowing about Hansen's disease and the fear of infection. As they repeated their discussions, many of the workers had a change of heart. Unfortunately, two core members of the colony left at this time.

-----It is a great blow to our business to lose important talents, but we cannot distort the ideal policy of Tokyo Colony -----

Mr. Shirabe, the general manager, made the final decision.

 However, there was one last problem to solve. It was who could be my roommate in the dormitory.

Mr. Shirabe had anticipated the possibility that no one would agree to be with me. He had also decided to let me stay in his own house in case things went wrong. But this concern was also dispelled by the words of Mr. Hideo Takahashi, who suffered from cerebral palsy.

 “He is fine with my room. I believe in medicine and science!”

## Bottom of Bowl

I was admitted to Tokyo Colony on June 2, 1969.

 I was assigned to the typing section.

 Almost a month passed, and I got used to the work place and could afford to observe the surroundings calmly.

 In the dormitory there was something different and distant from the workplace. The reason was not clear, but I could only feel a strange and unfamiliar atmosphere.

In the dining room, when I had finished my meal, I usually put my dishes away. That day, my empty bowl slipped out of the cook's hand. It rolled to my step and turned over.

-----What?

There was a round mark on the back of the bowl. The cook hurriedly picked up the bowl and wrapped it in her apron.

-----What was that round mark? Why was she in such a hurry? At the morning table the next day, I pretended to be casual and picked up all the dishes in front of me and checked them. As expected, I saw round marks on the backs of all my dishes. It was the same as yesterday.

 I checked the back of the dishes of Mr. Hideo Takahashi, who was next to me while I helped him clear the table. There were no marks... none on Haruo's dishes either.

-----I see, it was obvious that the utensils provided for my use were different from those of others.

 There was also something strange about the use of the men's shower room. I took a closer look and found that only four people were using the shower room: Mr. Haruo Takahashi, the prepress manager, Mr. Hideo Takahashi, Mr. Saburo Kusunoki, the phototypesetting machine operator, and me.

 Eight other people went to the nearby public bathhouse “Bath for Everyone” on purpose, saying, “We want to take a bath just before going to bed. This was to avoid taking a bath with me.

 It's hard… I suddenly felt depressed.

 A few days later, I was called into the director's room.

 There were three people in the room, general manager, Mr. Shirabe in the middle and Mr. Iwasaki Koichi and Ms. Umemoto Mitsue on his sides. These two people graduated from Nihon Fukushi University in the spring and started working at the colony.

 Mr. Iwasaki opened his mouth.

“Mr. Iha, you declared before coming to the colony that you would not escape Hansen's disease, didn't you? I was impressed by that, so I decided to do my best to help you. But once you entered the colony, did you abandon your single-minded way?”

 Ms. Umemoto blushed.

 “That's right. I find it sad...

 “Why can you stay calm? Why don't you get angry?”

 “Mr. Iha, do you know that your dishes are put away separately and disinfected? Even though we have talked many times, I'm ashamed!”

 “I heard that many people in the dormitory do not bathe with you. You pretend not to see them. You are a coward!”

“Director, all the people in Tokyo Colony are so horrible!”

 Director Shirabe looked confused.

 “I didn't know that... such things happened?”

 Hearing their conversation, I could not gather my thoughts and hesitated to answer.

 “You should call up all the workers and give them a notice from the director!”

 “That's right. We should have another workplace discussion!”

 Their suggestion led to an unexpected development. But despite their enthusiasm, I began to think that there was something wrong with their way of dealing with the problem.

 “Wait a minute please. I knew all about this. And please do not give them the director's warning. Now they are all confused. I'd like to try to believe them. I think they are struggling with their old consciousness within themselves.

 Little by little, something like certainty welled up inside myself.

 “The director's warning would certainly have some force, since it would be pushed by the orders and reason of the organization's top management. But in this way, I think it will only have the effect of tying up their emotional region. I think ‘prejudice’ could be overcome for the first time when emotions are raised to the level of consciousness. In the workplace, including dormitory life, it could be changed by building their trust in me. Maybe my efforts are not enough. It proves that I am not accepted by them as a member as I am now. I want to believe my friends in the colony. I think for both of us, me and my friends, we haven't had enough time, have we?”

My words must have come as a complete surprise to them. They looked at each other. Director Shirabe thought for a while and opened his mouth.

 “What do you think, let's wait this time. It's only been a month and a half since he came here. How about believing that they are just getting ready to take off their old clothes. If he stays the same and doesn't change, then we can think of another way.”

There was no need to think of any other way; after about four months, every behavior became natural. Needless to say, the round marks on the bottom of dishes disappeared and everyone returned to the colony bathroom.

 Then, one by one, six young men came to the colony. Who pushed them was the caseworker I'd first met at the colony.

## Human Shape

After that, Tokyo Colony took the opportunity of the welfare administration promotion measures put forth by the Minobe Tokyo Metropolitan Government to expand new facilities one after another.

 In 1972, the company was entrusted with the management of Katsushika Welfare Factory, Japan's first welfare factory for the physically disabled; in 1974, it opened Higashimurayama Colony Printing Plant; in 1975, it was entrusted with the management of Tokyo Ohta Welfare Factory; in 1981, it was entrusted with the management of Tokyo Hachioji Independence Home; in 1982, it established Tocollo Information Processing Center, which has grown to employ more than 800 people.

I became the chief editor of the newly established editorial department in 1972, manager of Nakano Factory in 1973, manager of Higashimurayama Printing House in 1983, manager of Colony Printing House in 1988, and the executive director of Tokyo Social Welfare Corporation and Zencolo Corporation in 1993. At the same time, I was assigned to the public role at Japan National Council of Social Welfare and Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Social Welfare Council.

The daily life on the “welfare site” led me to a certain kind of doubts. One of them was the limit of my abilities as a welfare manager. I felt that I was losing my passion, and I was sure that the time to leave the role was near.

 Another factor was that in 1994 the debate about the abolition of the “Leprosy Prevention Law” had begun among the people concerned. I was worried about how it would come to an end, but it was ended by a “total repentance theory” in which no one would take responsibility, as I had thought.

-----To write down and leave behind the record of human sorrow that has been lost and sealed----- I was driven by the thought that there was still work for me to do.

 To me it was a decision made after much deliberation, but to others it seemed like a sudden resignation.

 In August 1995, I retired from Tokyo Colony Social Welfare Corporation.

 In the twenty-six years since I had left the Hansen's disease facility, it had only been a rush through, but those days at that welfare site had been my life itself.

Mr. Nomura Minoru, who had a great influence on me during my tenure, passed away in March 1996 at the age of 95. He served as president of Tokyo Medical Caseworkers Association and chairman of Japan Christian Overseas Medical Cooperation Association, etc., and my relationship with him was as chairman of Zencolo Incorporated Association and president of Tokyo Colony Social Welfare Corporation.

Not only did he translate Albert Schweitzer's “The Primeval Forest” and introduce it to Japan, but he also visited Schweitzer in Africa to support his work, simply a man of principle and action.

When he was the director of Tokyo White Cross Hospital, he refused to surrender “humanistic medicine” to “arithmetic medicine,” insisting that “seeking profit as a hospital manager is not the way of medicine,” and finally left the hospital saying, “I lost to money.

He was consistent with this attitude from the beginning to the end in the world of social welfare.

At first glance, he seemed gentle, but when he argued about politics and society, he was like breathing fire, and he also had a hard eye on people. He fought against any power, did not allow himself to be taken in by any authority, and maintained his high level of vigilance against the opposition.

His intensity showed no mercy while I was serving as a print shop manager or general manager of Tokyo Colony. His words against me, who repeatedly used the words “organization” and “management,” were needle-sharp.

“There was no such word as 'management' before, and I wonder when the small group of people began to manage a large number of people as if they were commodities. Should I understand management as the role to guarantee the freedom and equality of human relationships and human emotions? I usually worry that management might kill people...”

Here is what happened to me in the days when I was the manager of Higashimurayama Colony Printing House.

 “Mr. Nomura, while you are making such an effort to go around the offices once a month, I think it is too good for me to talk to you only by myself, how about planning opportunities to talk to employees face to face?

 He quickly carried out my suggestion with the condition that “within the number of people who can hear each other”.

 The meeting lasted about a year, and then he wrote his impressions in the public magazine of Tokyo Colony.

   “In a certain factory, the groundwork has laid for a monthly meeting of about ten people from each section starting in April this year. Although I go around

the factory once a month, I cannot remember the names of the people because

of my age, nor can I be sensitive to each of them. Then the manager suggested

we have a meeting with the employees. After all, we are both human beings.

Although I insisted on the need to talk to each other, I found it really difficult

to have a discussion. First of all, despite my intention to be heart-to-heart, the

 usual ego would become powerful, and we could not be as frank as a chitchat.

 It was not because the sweets were few ...

I should not have high expectations for the meeting that had just begun. It would take a long time to get used to ten people coming together once a year. Besides, it is not possible to be “heart-to-heart” only with words, unless we really ‘express whole ourselves’. Still, it is better than nothing. I would like to continue it patiently.”

 I made the regular management report to Mr. Nomura.

 “Mr. Iha, what is the current status of the handicapped?

 “Today, the symptoms of those who come to knock on the door of the colony are getting worse and older. The number of people who can do the printing work is getting smaller and smaller.”

 The director's expression changed immediately.

 “Mr. Iha, when did we start selecting people with disabilities for our company? Isn't it the other way around? People with disabilities choose Tokyo Colony, don't they? If the Colony closes its doors to them after just one interview, they will never get another chance, will they? I think their abilities can only be confirmed with time, can't they? Where would they go if they were rejected at the interview stage?”

It was the rebuke as if I had been drenched with cold water from my head to my feet.

 It reminded me of the same experience at the admissions interview.

If I had been rejected as “not fit for admission,” I would not be the person I am today. Before I knew it, I was on the “management side” with an arrogant attitude and was even about to forget my own past.

In these 26 years, I have met many different people, but I can't help but think of people with disabilities. I'm particularly blamed for encounters that made me aware of my lack of abilities.

“Mr. H. has been absent without leave for three days. When I visit his room, I feel someone is there, but he doesn't open the door. Our director is always indulgent with them, so he never changes.”

 “Mr. H. has been absent without leave for three days. When I visit his room, I feel someone is there, but he doesn't open the door. Our director is always soft with them, so he never changes.

 Mr. Sawano, the caseworker, rushed to the principal's room early in the morning. The problems with Mr. H. have been repeated many times. He goes on vacation for about a month and then suddenly shows up in the office and pops into the manager's room to say, "Hello”.

 “How are you, boss? I'm going to do my best from now on.”

 Then he works hard as if nothing had happened. It had been twelve years since he came to the colony after graduating from the special school. We expected him to change and let him move from the dormitory to the welfare apartment in Nakano Ward and challenge himself to an independent social life.

 He cried over his broken love, drank over the failure of his work, sighed and locked himself in his room, saying he could not see his own future, and his every situation became the subject of discussion by the institution's case workers.

“He was not ready for life outside the dormitory, he needed certain restraints.”

 “Morale at work will go down. He cannot be counted on at work.”

 Our conversation went in circles.

I had no other choice but to bow my head to the managers.

 “He has already been restricted in his work. He will surely come back to work, so let's give him some more time.”

 He was handicapped by cerebral palsy, fair-skinned with a handsome face. People called him “Tamasaburo,” after a Kabuki actor.

 “Come with me, director, please. It's on me, today.”

 Sometimes we had drinks together, but his wallet was never opened. He usually got drunk, cried loudly and clung to me.

“I was wrong, I shouldn't have been born. Oh, director, can you understand that I feel there is no way out?”

 I could not encourage him with a cliché like “Hang in there.”

“I will start a business with my friend. I'll be successful and donate to the colony.”

 With that he left the colony, and after a while he came back to the office window and started working again. He repeated this three times.

“I will find another way to live.”

 After several years, he announced his own decision to the welfare office and left the colony.

 “Hello, director? This is H., I've been sick in the hospital in Akita. When I get out of here, please let me work in the colony. I know the colony is the best place for me. I'll work hard next time.”

 But a few months later we received a letter from his family informing us of his death. One of our beloved handicapped friends who continued to be lost had passed away.

 The production manager had gone pale.

 “Someone dropped a soft drink on the disk. I'm afraid the data on the shelves in the storage room may have been erased. I've been checking them since this morning, and it's clear that at least 27 of them are useless. I think it was obviously a deliberate accident.

Three days later, Mr. N. visited the director's office, accompanied by the production manager and the general manager.

 “Mr. N. came forward himself. He says he was the one who broke the disks last year.

 We had an accident a year ago, when almost a hundred floppy disks were ruined.

 We found out its cause, even called the manufacturer's laboratory, and was reported-data erasure by magnetic force from the outside. We had mobilized all operators and had just finished re-entering the data....

We never thought that the accident would happen intentionally.

“I did it. I am sorry.”

 Mr. N. bowed his head, his eyes unfocused.

 “Is it true?”

 I still could not believe it.

 “Yes.”

“Could you leave us alone for a while, the manager and the boss? I just want to talk to Mr. N. alone.”

 Mr. N. sat directly in front of me and looked down uncomfortably, not adjusting his slanted glasses.

 “How old are you now?”

“Thirty-five...”

“How long have you been in the colony?”

 “Nineteen years.”

“Is that so? You were a little boy when you came here, but you are already so old. Didn't we share a room on our first company trip? Remember, you told me you'd never been to a strip show and seriously asked me to take you. Everyone knew the next day and it caused a stir. The female employers blamed us and said, 'Oh no, that's horrible! We were attacked and it took us a while to regain our confidence!’”

 N. opened his mouth slightly. He was handicapped by cerebral palsy, so his words were hard to understand unless you were very familiar with his speech.

“Why did you do such a fool?”

 He did not answer.

 “How did you erase data from disks?”

 Finally he opened his mouth.

 “During the training, I learned that the taboo for data was magnetic power. So I tried it once with a magnet. This time, not with a magnet, but I sprinkled the remains of a canned coffee.”

 “I see. But why? Besides, you did it twice. Remember the last time. Your colleagues even stayed up all night for many days to recover the data. You joined them, didn't you? Think about it... That means that you denied the work of the handicapped members, doesn't it? Moreover, you were one of the members who recovered the data. That's the most shameful thing. Will you deny your own work?”

 My voice became louder and louder. I saw myself in the figure of Mr. N., hunched over and shrinking.

“Director, I'll tell you the truth. I was drunk and came back to the dormitory late. I thought it would bother my roommates and decided to sober up with coffee. I went into the factory, sat down at my desk and drank coffee. I just drank coffee... and then the disk on the shelf laughed at me! 'You are worse than the others. The worst of the handicapped!' That's it. No matter how hard I try, it's no use. I can do less than a fraction of what they can do. The floppy disks knew everything. They are crammed with those things. And so....”

 Mr. N. was asked to leave the facility in accordance with the work rules.

 A year later, Mr. N. wrote to me.

 “I go to the local workplace now. I am not able to realize that I am working. Is it impossible to return to work in the colony?”

 I offered his readmission to the colony to the executive meeting. There was a heated discussion that concluded that it was too soon for him, and his hope was not fulfilled.

 Half a year later we received the news from his family that he died due to weakness from alcoholism.

 “Director, I wonder if marriage is inpossible without sex?”

Ms. Y. burst into tears in her wheelchair.

 “He says he definitely wants to have children when we get married. I have absolutely no confidence in my body.”

 “As I recall, you are from the National Rehabilitation Center for Persons with Disabilities, aren't you? Who is your doctor? Maybe he can give you some advice if you two go together.

 “I'm afraid he might say no. Besides, he was happy to report that he had already told his family about our marriage. All the more...and because he is healthy, it is natural...but whenever we travel together, I always try to avoid him. I don't want him to see my deformed body. I don't like it.”

She contracted polio before she was two years old, which curled her spine and stunted her growth from the waist down.

 She came to the colony after training at the National Rehabilitation Center for Persons with Disabilities, and had to give up on entering the colony at the first intake meeting because she could not move from her wheelchair to a bed and a western-style toilet. After three years of trying to build up her strength at home, she was finally accepted on the second try.

 “My mother always told me, 'Don't fall in love with anyone. You'll only end up suffering. Is that true? But I...”

 I waited for her to stop crying.

 “Ms. Y., do you really like Mr. O?”

 “Yes, I do.”

 “I see. Do you like everything about him?”

 “Yes, I do.”

 “I think Mr. O. feels the same way about you. He loves everything about you, including your curved spine.”

“But I'm afraid to show him my body...if it would cause the end of...”

 “If it would destroy your relationship, I think you better ruin it as soon as possible.” 

“But I'm afraid to show him my body...then everything would end...”

 “If it would cause the end of your relationship, I think it is better for you to ruin it as soon as possible.” 

 I kept her away. She bit her lip hard, wiped away her tears and left the room.

 It was the day before that year's summer vacation. The lunch break at the factory was more cheerful than usual. In such a situation, Mrs. Y. called to me. “We are going back to Akita, to our hometown.

 It was 7:30 in the morning of the first day back from summer vacation. There was a phone call from the night duty room of the office to my home.

 “Sorry to bother you so early in the morning. Ms. Y. has been waiting for your coming to work since before 7:00 am...”

 “What does she want?”

 “I've asked her repeatedly, but she won't tell me, saying, 'It's okay with me. I'll wait for him to come. And yet she has been waiting for so long...”

 I rushed to the office, wondering what was going on. She was standing outside the director's room with a big smile on her face. She looked down and said.

 “Director, we were fine.”

I understood everything.

 “I am glad to hear that! Your father will surely say, 'Congratulations,' and won't blame you for saying, 'What a slut before marriage.'“

 They were married on December 16, 1990. Two years later, they had a baby girl, Yukari. They now live in the Tokyo Metropolitan Housing for the Disabled in Nakano Ward and are busy raising their children with the help of local volunteer networks.

 “Hello, Grandpa Iha, my birthday is coming up, Yukari, I want books.”

 Yukari is almost four years old.
