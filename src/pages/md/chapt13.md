## Supplement 2   The Silence of Damien

The lights in the auditorium faded and the hymn began to play. There was the voice of Father Damien from the stage of total darkness.

“Usually around this time. At dusk. The sun was setting and…”

The curtain rose for the play ‘Father Damien’ starring Yamazaki Tsutomu. I sat in the back row of Parco Space Part 3 in Shibuya and fixed my eyes on the stage.

The two-act one-man play was about to end.

“Did I rather give them the bad influence?”

“Did I betray you?

“Am I disqualified as a priest?

“Was I too stubborn not to change my temperament?

“But because of my temperament, I had sought you hard and burned myself out. Once I knew the pain of love, there was no other way. You stayed with me in the ‘leper house’. The sufferings I had comforted, the wounds I had healed, were Yours …they were suffering of Christ and His wound. Please tell me it was, it exactly was. Give me your one word. And then all my suspicions will fade away like smoke.

Lord, if what separates you and me is this suspicion, I will throw it away. I will renounce it in your name. Whether I have done wrong or right, I am your servant. You are my God. I believe in your great love.

Father Damien kneels down at the foot of the cross. The light on his figure faded out.

July 3, 1922. Original work: by Aldyth Morris. Producer: Terence Knapp (script translation: Emiko Kuroda). "Father Damien" began to question us intensely, 104 years after his death.

Born in Bergy in 1840, Father Damien was entered the Reuben Monastery of the Sacred Heart at the age of 19 and went to Hawaii as a member of the missionary group. In the early 1800s, large numbers of Chinese immigrated to Hawaii to provide labor for the sugar cane farms. Hansen’s disease, brought in this route, quickly multiplied among the natives who had no immunity, and the survey in the 1860s reported that it had spread to 10~15% of the island’s inhabitants. In 1865, King Kamehameha enacted the “Isolation Law” as a countermeasure to the situation, and the patients were confined to Molokai Island, which was surrounded by cliffs. Molokai Island with its north shore the cliff upright in the sea, the sea is a deep abyss.

Father Damien, 33 years old, went alone to the island to save 800 patients and contracted Hansen’s disease himself at the age of 44* and died on April 15, 1889. He was 49 years old.

The death of Damien the Martyr was announced to the world.

Follow Damien!

Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of ‘Treasure Island’, visited the island during Father Damien’s lifetime, even after his death, had written an account of his trip in which he said:

‘The fools will deny the existence of God when they see the misery of the lepers, but even the fools will worship God in silence when they see how the sisters care for them.'
[^1]
[^1]: Later, many Hansen’s disease doctors questioned the idea that Fr. Damien contracted the disease during his relief work on Molokai Island. Some claim, though he did contract the disease, it must have been in his childhood or before his visit to Hawaii.

In the March 1984 issue of ‘Tama’ (the monthly magazine of Tama Zenshoen), Fuyu Toshiyuki published his article entitled “The Statue of ‘Damien Disfigured’”.

The presentation of this article begins with the fact that the Saitama Museum of Modern Art purchased the statue of “Damien Disfigured,” the masterpiece of engraver Horikoshi Yasutake, and placed it in its permanent exhibition as the museum’s theme work.

Regarding this exhibition, the Hansen’s Disease Recovered Association in Tokyo asked the museum to remove the statue, since the statue of Damien, who was affected by Hansen’s Disease, exaggerates the disease and frightens the visitors to the museum. Under protest, the museum removed the statue, concluding that although the artistic quality is high, it should be removed because there are people who are forced to suffer because of it.

Mr. Fuyu’s thesis gave rise to the later arguments, mainly in the magazine ‘Tama’ and others, about “exhibiting” or “removing” one work of art. I will quote Mr. Fuyu’s thesis, which was the beginning of the arguments, in as much detail as possible, and then quote the main points of other theses on my own responsibility. I have made some additions and corrections to my thesis “The Silence of Damien”. Parentheses in the quoted texts have been changed where appropriate.

“The residents of the sanatorium must have heard of Father Damien once or twice. I heard his name several times when I was in the sanatorium. I do not remember them as good impressions. It was because Father Damien was considered to be the only adult ‘leper’ in the over 60-year history of the sanatorium.  
The fact that Hansen’s disease is not contagious, except in infants, was known early on. The fact that not a single staff member had contracted the　disease was a powerful weapon in the fight against the disease. But as if to　put a damper on it, ‘absolute isolationists’ said, ‘You know, there’s Damien,　isn’t there? ‘That was really hard...
“

"...the standing statue of ‘Damien Disfigured’, with nodules erupting from his face and the backs of his hands, stood well over 2 meters on the　pedestal. Wearing the formal gauntlet of Father and broad-brimmed hat,　the slightly downcast figure looked both frightening and somewhat sad...”

Mr. Fuyu quotes some lines from "Huge Rock and Petals" by engraver Horikoshi Yasutake about his state of mind while carving "Damien Disfigured".

  “The statue carved with a trembling heart is after all ugly and terrible, whether it is excellent or not. I cannot deny that some people will be deeply moved by seeing the statue, but before you are artistically moved, it may be necessary to point out that there will be elementary and junior high school students who will stand paralyzed with horror in front of the statue...

“...the artistic superiority or inferiority of the statue and the insistence on its removal is another matter entirely. Whether the statue itself is superior or not, it will still be a problem if it does not accurately reflect the reality and if it frightens the socially rehabilitated and their families. In addition, if the work happens to be superior, many people will appreciate it and have a great influence. Furthermore, when young people who are not yet ready for sufficient artistic appreciation look at the statue, they may be overwhelmed by the external ugliness before they perceive the ‘beauty’ contained in the statue. Everyone knows that the memories etched into young minds are not easily erased.”

“...the statue of ‘Damien Disfigured’...there are four statues that are exactly the same. three of them are now untouched (January 8th).  
The Hansen’s Disease Recovered Association plans to negotiate with the engraver. Even so, Pre. Iwate and Pre. Hyōgo, both of them are too far away......"

“Within 30 or 40 years, the issue on prejudice against Hansen’s disease will no longer be a social problem in Japan. Not that the prejudices will disappear, but Hansen’s disease as an object of prejudice will almost disappear. How many residents of sanatoriums, whose average age is 62, will still be alive after 30 years? I think that most of the people who have returned to society hope that the statue of ‘Damien Disfigured’ will not make unnecessary waves for a while until then.”

Mr. Fuyu presented his essay “‘Damien Disfigured’ After” in May 1985. It consists of complementing the previous work, adding his artistic point of view.

“On the east side of the entrance to the doctor’s office is the bronze bust of the late former director Hayashi Yoshinobu... Actually, it is the work of Funakoshi Yasutake, who made the statue of ‘Damin Disfigured’. It is too natural that the bust of Mr. Hayashi is realistic, capturing the features of the subject very well, but this realistic technique could be said to the statue of Damien..."

“Last March 5th, we also met and talked with Mr. Funakoshi at the Zenshoen Social Center...Mr. Funakoshi said that he never expected such a thing to happen. Moreover, he was disappointed that none of his friends and acquaintances, and those in charge of the facilities had advised him that something like this would happen (to invite misunderstanding in the world, as he put it). He said that he had asked Mr. Hayashi, the former director, and other doctors about Hansen’s disease. However, it is questionable how much of the specific social problems of ‘leprosy’, such as the problems of people returning to society, prejudice and discrimination, have been studied or understood in the investigation ... in short, it is a lack of common sense to make such a statue. It is also extremely unreasonable to display it."

“If asked if there is any damage from the statue of Damien, I cannot answer. If asked if people who have returned to society live in such fear, I would clearly say no.”

I presented “The Silence of Damien,” the counterargument to Mr. Fuyu, in the December 1985 issue of ‘Tama’.

“An artist is under attack. The life of his work is being denied. The artist isFunakoshi Yasutake and the work is ‘Damien Disfigured’.  
I was just surprised to read Mr. Fuyu’s essay in ‘Tama’ March 1984.  
He denounced ‘Damien Disfigured’ as ugly and demanded the removal of
 the statue because it incites public prejudice against Hansen’s disease when displayed in public. He reported that the Saitama Modern Art Museum had accepted his request.  
Mr. Fuyu and I have several things in common.  
I have also suffered from Hansen’s disease, and I am one of those who have returned to society with aftereffects on my legs and hands.  
However, there are fundamental differences in the appreciation of the ‘Damien Disfigured’ statue, his perception of artistic visions and his way to counter the prejudices against Hansen’s disease. I must consider it a blessing that I do not have to waste my nerves in words or expressions in writing my counter-arguments.  
Mr. Fuyu attacks the statue of ‘Damien Disfigured’ in his prologue, writes about Father’s historical existence, sometimes giving excuse to the “absolute isolationism” of the medical administration and, as if he had been used by it and minimizes Father’s noble sacrifice.  
The statue of ‘Damien Disfigured’ was created by the engraver Funakoshi Yasutake out of his reverence for the life of Father Damien.  
An artist, obsessed with beauty and moved by the human spirit, fixed his gaze on Damien and realized that it was the inner beauty that surpassed the that made the statue complete. Does this work of art torment Hansen’s disease patients or the cured and their families?  
In 1873, patients were dumped into the corner of the island of Molokai, that was the place even said that “whoever enters this place should abandon all hope”. Father Damien applied and took up his post, alone among the hungry patients who had no place to live.  
With what feeling should we accept his self-sacrifice and courage, while superimposing our own weakness?  
Father Damien’s responsibilities were too heavy for him to bear alone. According to his autobiography, he washed the wounds of patients stigmatized as ‘living corpses’, lived with them, and, after ten years, contracted the disease himself.  
It seems that Mr. Fuyu wanted to deny Father Damien’s infection and development of the disease as ‘unacceptable autobiography’. If you discuss the historical event of a religious figure only in terms of ‘the possibility of Hansen’s disease infection in adults’ and question whether the fact of medical infection is true or not, you will miss the essence of Father Damien’s self-sacrifice.  
When discussing prejudices about Hansen’s disease, we must be careful to make a clear distinction between the pathological aspects and the social recognition, and above all, we must be cool enough not to talk about it in an emotional way towards the people affected. The confusion between an infectious disease and a highly contagious disease is one of them.  
The poor society becomes the breeding ground for the outbreak of the disease, and the contracting of the disease is caused by the relationship between individual characteristics and conditions.  
‘Prejudice’ is created and nurtured by intentional social consciousness.  
Hansen’s disease is called ‘retribution for one’s evil deeds’ in Buddhism and ‘God’s work’ in Christianity, and it has been considered the worst of all human diseases.  
Unfortunately, the disease also caused “ugliness” in appearance and limbs, which justified the fear of the disease. In addition, the wrong medical administration enforced the ‘Absolute Isolation Eradication Principle’ and played the role of fixing the social consciousness. As a result, Hansen’s disease was burdened with an unfortunate history.  
But medical progress has made it possible to recover from Hansen’s disease.  
The remaining problems are the wisdom and courage of mankind to overcome ‘unfounded prejudices and discrimination’.  
Mr. Fuyu said, ‘In 30 or 40 years, Hansen’s disease will no longer be a social problem. Not that prejudices will disappear, but Hansen’s disease as an object of prejudice will almost disappear’. He makes it sound as if the remaining lives of the people left in the sanatorium, whose average age is 60, could be the condition for the disappearance of prejudice.  
Will that be enough to deal with the prejudices that actually exist, just to shut our mouths, hide ourselves, and surrender to the passage of time?  
The way to respond to the suffering of those who were driven out from their homes, cut off from communication with others, and about to end their lives in sanatoriums could not be rewarded by hiding truths or distorting history.  
We are alive now!  
The suffering of the stigmatized continues.  
As long as the historical and social prejudices and the facts exist, we should not choose the path of going with the flow of time to forget.  
Has the energy that boiled up during the struggle against the ‘Leprosy Prevention Law’ been extinguished, or have the human rights of the arginalized been restored? No, I don’t think so!  

In fact, so much so that there are friends who tremble in front of works of art. What problem can be solved or what progress can be made just by changing the name from ‘leprosy’ to ‘Hansen’s disease’ or by simply being silence on our part?

I myself got married 14 years ago to a nurse who worked in the Hansen’s disease sanatorium.

What awaited our family was the apartment house for staff only, where no one else lived forever, and the denial of our children by the workplace nursery. We were made to realize that there is a huge gap between ‘emotions’ and ‘scientific awareness’ in human society.

We were exhausted.

“Please don’t talk about ‘Hansen’s disease’ anymore. It will be better for our children. It is enough that your limbs are disabled. Let’s go and live where no one knows about your past.”

I could not do it. Finally, my wife and children left me.

Fighting ‘prejudice’ without even the consent of one’s family could have been against humanity.

Is a society worthy of being called modern if it does not allow a person who has been cured of a disease to declare it, to marry, to have children and to live on his own?

‘Prejudice and Discrimination’ is the shame of modern society. It was the hard end for me, but I have no inertia to live snuggling up to the shame, then and now.

The society that can only be changed by waiting is the society that does not progress, and the society that waits idly is the society to come, which is difficult to live in for the socially weak.

   My body gets hot when I stand in front of the statue of ‘Damien Disfigured’. His sad eyes stare at man. His stooped posture has loneliness all by itself.

   Mr. Funakoshi is the artist who engraves objects realistically, moving away from academic realism and brewing up feelings of time and life.

   When we appreciate the series of his works ‘Twenty-six Martyrs Monument’, ‘Damien Disfigured’ and ‘Hara-no-jo (Christian Samurai)’, we recognize him as an artist who takes religion, love and humanity as his theme and confronts them. We will be filled with shame when we see these works face to face with our minds buried in idleness, deception, and self-preservation.

   In his book ‘Huge Rock and Petals’ he mentions his work on ‘Damien Disfigured’ as follows.

‘It is miserable to deliberately strive to be eccentric only to give the viewer something unusual and stimulating. If the picture or engraving has not been made into the elements of psychological constructs at a high level through deformation, it is nothing but a distortion, and it even seems completely meaningless and rather shabby.

Drawing an ordinary object in an ordinary way, and yet penetrating deeply into the human heart with high dignity, should be precisely the original attitude of the artist.’

Mr. Fuyu, in his attack on the artwork, quotes Mr. Funakoshi Yasutake as follows.

‘Suddenly I made nodules, as if I were rushing at his beautiful face. I cut off his eyebrows, smashed his nose and made his ears swell. At that moment I felt as if I had become the devil.’

It is the low dimensional reading to understand Mr. Funakoshi’s state of mind at that moment, in connection with ‘disfigured’ and ‘devil’.

It is said that there were two photographs that inspired Mr. Funakoshi to engrave the statue of Father Damien. One was when he was 13 years old, and the other was 3 months before his death from illness.

Mr. Funakoshi was robbed of his heart by Father Damien’s noble way of life, and the more he approached the subject realistically, the more the human suffering of Damien, who had left a note saying, ‘Don’t show this picture to my family,’ must have reached his ears.

Himself who tries to assimilate, himself who challenges. The engraver’s heart must have wavered. What other expression could be found to describe the spirit that overcame the conflict than ‘became the devil’?

The statue of Damien is the very human praise of ‘love’ that exists deep within disfigured by disease.

The expression on Damien’s face is never just that of ugliness without dignity.

Today, ‘Damien Disfigured’ is under attack by some as ‘an art that encourages prejudice’.

To attack it only for its ‘ugliness’ is to deny the whole life of the artwork, considering the intentions behind its creation.

   Mr. Fuyu also criticizes Mr. Funakoshi, saying that his creation of ‘Damien Disfigured’ was itself the result of his ignorance and lack of common sense about Hansen’s disease.

   What on earth does it mean to know ‘Hansen’s disease’?

  Or does it mean that we must be qualified by our own experience of Hansen’s disease?

   We should avoid the folly of creating a new taboo that limits expression in art and literature.

   It is natural that the critical attitude to prejudice and that of artistic expression should be judged by different rules.

   Although the statue of Damien has a profound effect on those who appreciate it, it definitely does not give the feeling of hatred. But even if we admit that there are some who feel only ‘ugliness’ from it, there is nothing to be afraid of.

This work of art could never have any influence on those who have lost their

emotions in connection with the imprinting of “new promotion of prejudices.

The statue of Damien has been moved from the permanent exhibition hall to

 the director’s reception room. No, it was not moved, it would be more correct

 to say that it was hidden.

Opponents demanded: ‘If young people who are not mature in artistic appreciation look at the statue, they will be overwhelmed by its outer ugliness before they feel its inner beauty. As a result, the lives of those who have returned to society and their families will be frightened. Therefore, the statue should be hidden in a place out of sight of the ordinary visitors.

   At the protest table, the director's comment revealed that he considered ‘The Statue of Damien’ equivalent to ‘The Hiroshima Panels’.

 It was surprising that the artistic evaluation on the part of the Museum was at this level. ‘The Statue of Damien’ is the praise of humanity itself, and ‘The Hiroshima Panels’ is the rage against violence in its theme.

  Putting them in the same category of ‘ugliness’, there is nothing to say!

The works of art for the permanent exhibition are purchased in accordance with the artistic standards of each museum, which, of course, must select the works of art as the cultural treasures of their prefectures after considering the intention of the authors of the works, the social background of the works, the evaluations of each work, and so on. The works of art that deal with social have always been attacked. The directors and curators of museums who are disturbed by the attacks of some people or who cannot answer the questions of the protesters will have their judgment as guardians of the Hall of Fame questioned and will be disqualified.

If you continue to remove and hide the statue of Damien under attack, you are not even responding to the mandate of the citizens. The primary importance of your role is that you exist as a guardian of artistic culture.

 Because of unjustified prejudice is real, now we must not force ‘Damien Disfigured’ to be silent.”

I immediately received a polite reply from Mr. Funakoshi, who had read my controversy in ‘Tama’ magazine.

“I received unexpected protests from all those who suffered from Hansen’s disease. I had no word against their comment that my artwork had caused them pain. But here is someone who really understands my work. I appreciate you very much. If I could take one of my works to heaven, I would choose ‘Damien Disfigured’ without hesitation.”

In ‘Tama’ magazine, Jan. 1986, Dr. Harada Nobuo mentioned that he had a different view from Mr. Fuyu, and presented the opinions of his nine friends. He made them all anonymous. He explained the reason: “Since most of them are famous people, I am afraid that adding their names and positions might give more weight to their opinions. If necessary, I am willing to give their names”.

‘Before whether the statue is artistic or not, I can’t help but feel angry at people who refuse to make the world aware of the person who fought against the battle (be it leprosy or something else) more than a hundred years ago... I think that informing people about the reality of the disease and fighting the battle aggressively will move people and make them understand the way and try to walk with them.' (A: Doctor of the Hansen’s Disease Sanatorium)

‘...thinking of Damien’s life, I feel strong opposition to Mr. Fuyu Toshiyuki saying, ‘It is a lack of common sense to make such a statue’...and to avoid misunderstanding, put the interpretation about leprosy and Damien next to the statue...I object to squeezing the statue into the parlor’ (B: Doctor of the Hansen’s Disease Sanatorium)

‘...to hide what is inconvenient, to preserve what should be overcome, there is a danger that the idea itself will becomes a prejudice.' (C: former doctor of the Hansen’s Sanatorium)

‘I think Mr. Fuyu’s theory is the same, that cured patients themselves can cause prejudice, discrimination and fear of leprosy by their deformity or aftereffects, so they should not come out in public...' (D: Doctor)

‘Japan is the place where leprosy is coming to an end, but millions of people around the world suffer from this disease. I believe that people who say, ‘Please leave leprosy alone,’ will not be able to grapple with leprosy...’ (E: Pathologist)

‘...I think the problem is that these people also take everything as prejudice. I can well understand that people temporarily fall into such excessive self-defense when they ‘wake up to discrimination’. It is the same with other disabled people. But it is only a step in the evolution, and it will make him unhappy if he does not overcome it...it is regrettable that the director of the museum has withdrawn his statement about the ‘Hiroshima panels’... (F: Catholic priest)

‘...I had the impression that it was very similar to the case of “Wandering Ryukyuan” by Hirotsu Kazuo, which deals with discrimination in Okinawa ... The way to hide the matter without overcoming what is uncomfortable for oneself may have been the factor that made leprosy itself unhappy.' (G: The writer lives in Okinawa)

‘...to express the truth as the truth as it is, because I believe that there is no other way to overcome prejudice. Mr. Fuyu does not understand this, I think. (H: Writer)

‘...Mr. Fuyu talks about influencing children with a frozen heart, which is nothing else but a reflection of his own. I think the most important thing is to teach children not to hide, to let them look at things directly, to think without prejudice, and to act like human beings. No problem is solved by hiding it, only by leaving obscure prejudices.' (I: psychiatrist)

Mr. Harada presents two different points from Mr. Fuyu. One is G’s: the writer lives in Okinawa. The other is the way of thinking that ‘...because it might be (or...because of fear of) ...you should...’. This is the biggest thing that has made the lepers unhappy. In fact, it always hangs around the security measure for the mentally handicapped... We often hear them say, “Those who have not suffered from leprosy cannot understand the suffering of lepers,” but this is the word that most denies mutual understanding. Understanding leprosy presupposes the possibility of mutual understanding.

Mr. Fuyu published his third essay in ‘Tama’, Feb. 1986.

“‘Damien Disfigured’ and My Response to Unjustified Criticism by Mr. Iha Who Left the Sanatorium”. It was his rebuttal to my essay “The Silence of Damien,” as the specially added subtitle makes clear.

‘When I read his essay, there were two things that struck me as odd, first of all. One was that his argument was emotional and he had not seen the essence properly. The other was, why did he come to the opposite conclusion from us, in spite of his actual experience as his foundation written in ‘Challenge Against Prejudice’?  
...I have never thought of avoiding the discussion as art. Why did I not write it? The reason is obvious. Because the essence of this argument lies where art has nothing to do with it. To add a little, neither artistic superiority or inferiority affects the strength or weakness of prejudice, nor the essence of the argument is the same whether the writer is famous or unknown.

‘Certainly, prejudice and discrimination may not be something that will go away if left alone.  
It is not always the right person who wins the game in the world. Human
life cannot be built on logic or public stances alone. Prejudice against Hansen’s disease is neither science nor theory. Even if prejudice and discrimination are ‘the shame of modern society’ as Mr. Iha says, even if ‘not to fall into the inertia of living snuggling up to the shame’, it will not be a shame for mankind to wish to suffer as little harm as possible...’

How to cope with prejudice is a very difficult problem. It will be right to challenge it directly, as Mr. Iha has done. In order to do so, one must make it clear that he himself once suffered from Hansen’s disease. But how many of those who have returned to society are able to make it clear? In most cases, their livings are threatened long before, at the stage when ‘Hansen’s disease’was suspected...

But as far as people are concerned, no matter how respectable a person is, he will make a mistake. It happens that you do something for good and the result is the opposite. I know Mr. Funakoshi to be a conscientious man.

However, since not only I, but also several people who have returned to society and seen the statue, have come to the conclusion that there is a problem with the statue, it is natural to protest... ‘

Looking at his rebuttal, I had to read the end of the argument between the lines. Because I felt that it was void to continue the argument as it was.

On November 4, 1986, the evening edition of The Mainichi Newspaper carried the matter as its lead story: “‘Damien Disfigured,’ the statue of Father dedicated to the salvation of Hansen’s Disease, will be removed.” There were details of the process leading up to the removal, Mr. Noya, the president of the “Association in Tokyo Who Have Left Institutions” who requested the removal, and my commentary from the other side of the removal.

In the same year, Mr. Saeki Sadamichi published his essay “Reconsideration on Prejudice and Discrimination” in the December issue of ‘Tama’.

“Looking back on the course of this argument, my ‘declaration of innocence’ began to seem like a too superficial ‘general remark’. But Mr. Fuyu’s third essay was so severe as to silence the opponents, and I wondered if I was the only one who felt that his sense of being victimized had been aggravated to emotional...  
 Rather, I felt that his attitude was to stick to his own opinion and not to listen to others. In addition, his reference to the ‘removal of the statue of Damien’ as the ‘general consensus’ of the association was incorrect. When I first attended their meeting in January 1986, they talked about it only a little. I think Mr.Fuyu had already finished his text by then. It was after the statue had been
removed, and the meeting was adjourned for lack of time without a vote, but I thought from the beginning that it was going too far to demand its removal...  

It is necessary to make our general opinion known to the outside world.

But I am afraid that if we become self-righteous or narrow-minded, we may lose our friend who understands us well or our willing partners...

I think there is no need to repeat that there is more than just the question of whether or not to let Damien talk about leprosy’ or not, but also many problems in formulating the basic idea broadly and deeply for the action we should take...

That is, these problems can be summed up in one issue, which is formally the amendment of a bad law (Leprosy Prevention Law), and  enlightenment and the elimination of prejudice and discrimination...First of all, I agree with the amendment of the Leprosy Prevention Law. However, I have found that there are strange objections against it.   According to them, they oppose it because the rights guaranteed by the bad law will be violated if the law is changed.

The second is that the argument about whether to change the law or not has

 turned into an argument about “Being a warrior or being a beggar.” I doubt that it can be such a simple matter to argue with such two choices. I am neither a warrior nor a beggar, and I want to find the third way to establish a basic human right guaranteed by the Constitution...  

Mr. Yawata Masao commented on this issue in ‘Bungei Hiroba’, October 1987.

“Patients and ex-patients appeal to the need for proper education so that tragedies are not repeated because of prejudice. On the other hand, they have strong personal feelings about being left alone without making waves. They live, so to speak, suffering from the contradiction between their real feelings and their public stances. No matter how much the artist’s intention is spiritual expression, his feelings that disgusting is disgusting are pure. To suppress them in the name of art is the arrogance of art, which may be the oppression of human beings.

Just because it is a work of art, it does not have the direction that God has.  The smooth social relationship cannot be built without respecting the naive feeling that disgusting is disgusting. Harassment occurs when one dares to do things that others don’t like, which is the same as daring to create nuclear weapons that destroy the peace everyone seeks and invite wars.

 But that is the difficulty of art. What artists expect from their paintings or engravings are the expression of something like inner joy or sorrow or anger through them, and that works of art whose characteristics are individual and original, do not need the beauty of the greatest common denominator.

Mr. Otani Fujio argues in his “Contemporary Stigma” as follows.

  ‘When I came across the essays of Mr. Fuyu and Mr. Iha, both recovered from Hansen’s disease, I read them with surprise at first, and then with respect and some kind of impression...

I think that in a democratic society, ‘freedom of artistic expression is, in principle, fully guaranteed, as is freedom of thought and belief and expression’. But when it ‘may violate the human rights of the socially weak and minorities,’ it should of course be discussed and ‘decided relatively’ from a human point of view.

The Saitama Modern Art Museum’s action of moving the statue to the director’s room and opening it only to applicants seemed like the way of petty officials and irresponsible, but I think it was good for the time being.

Patients, even those in recovery, are still in a position of social prejudice and weakness. In the reality that these people are irritated and angry, continue to fight tooth and nail to correct the prejudice, it is inevitable that society to stand on fair judgment, and put some restriction on the artwork may be inevitable...The controversy between two people in ‘Tama’ is the first step to real freedom.

More recently, in March 1994, in ‘Kikuchino,’ published by the Kikuchikeifuen Association, Mr. Akira Ota touched on the subject in ‘Around Damien.’

“Although Mr. Fuyu and Mr. Iha, one a decade younger than the other at the time, both graduated from Nagashima High School. They overcame many obstacles, returned to society, married a healthy person, and lived with their

families in the same suburbs of Tama. Their arguments as persons returned to society was paid attention to inside and outside.

Surely it would be unreasonable to expect a calm state of mind from
 rehabilitated persons who live in the same area where the museum permanently exhibits a statue of ‘Damien’ so realistically carved that they can imagine a seriously ill patient in an untreated pre-war state, without special medicines or chemotherapy. Moreover, it is no exaggeration to say that people who return to society with aftereffects on their important faces or hands fear that their livelihood may be threatened... I left the museum as the sun was setting, praying for peace and healing for Damien, who will forever stand like a ghost with his pitiful figure full of pain.

The controversy over the work of art statue “Damien Disfigured” was a dispute between “Do not allow the exhibition because it invites misunderstanding and prejudice”, “Freedom of expression in the work of art” and “How to face prejudice”. I have summarized these arguments mainly from the magazine ‘Tama’ and opinions from other publications in chronological order under my responsibility, from the need to leave the conclusion to future generations.

In 1993, the statue of “Damien Disfigured”, which had been attacked and removed as a work of art promoting prejudice against Hansen’s disease, was exhibited as an opening memento in the entrance hall of the Prince Takamatsu Hansen’s Disease Memorial Hall.

 But even today, after the abolition of the “Leprosy Prevention Law”, the statue of “Damien Disfigured” is still kept in the director’s room of the Saitama Modern Art Museum.

Despite the fact that people suffered from Hansen’s disease are finally beginning to regain their human dignity by cutting off the unreasonable yoke, works of art are still bound in silence and captivity.

After all, the “statue of Damien Disfigured” ought to greet the citizens of Saitama Prefecture at the entrance hall of the Saitama Modern Museum.

The statue of Damien would ask visitors hard questions.

Why did mankind commit sins?

Why did they push Hansen’s patients into the depths of grief?

Do you know?

That they did not even allow the Hansen’s patients to live together...
