<!-- # Kagiyadefuu (Ryukyuan Dance for a Feast)　 -->

## Group of Urns

It was 1996, the heat of the August sun was on my back, even after five o’clock

the sweat was running down in streams.

“Ryo, this was your nursery school. You went there until you were six, Yui until

she was three.”

Ryo stopped and looked around.

“Yes, I remember. This pine tree is just as it was, and it looks like time has stopped...”

I wanted to tell my son about the illness I had suffered and the place of torment of my youth.

As we walked through the well-organized hedge, people greeted us as we passed.

“Hello.”

My son’s voice was nervous and he even had a look of puzzlement on his face.

“Are they all sick people?”

“No, they’re not. In fact, 95 percent of them are not sick. They have already recovered. There are 13 national Hansen’s disease sanatoriums and 2 private ones in Japan, and about 5500 people still live there. There are about 600 people living in this Tama Zenshoen. The number of Hansen’s disease cases has been reduced to less than 10 in a year today, but there are 1.26 million Hansen’s disease patients concentrated in the Asia-Africa region.”

“Such a large number of them around the world?”

“Most of them are from the Asia-Africa region. They say that any disease is closely related to their society...lives in poverty. The incidence rate of Hansen’s disease is especially correlated with the standard of living. “

“You said that 95 percent of them are cured, right? Then why are they still in the sanatorium? I have another question. Even though there are 5500 people living in sanatoriums now, they did not teach us about them in school.”

“It’s a natural question. If you contract Hansen’s disease, the ‘Hansen’s Disease Protection Act’ forces you into a sanatorium, cutting off contact with family and friends. Once isolated in a sanatorium, patients never returned to their old society. Today, the average age of inmates is over seventy. As you pointed out, it is a problem that it is not taught in schools, but it can also be said that Hansen’s disease patients were wiped out before citizens by forced isolation. That is why people never had a chance to meet them. Have you ever heard or seen anything about Hansen’s disease?”

“No, I hardly have. I’ve looked it up myself since I met you. Have you seen the movie ‘Ben Hur’? When I read the novel ‘Castle of Sand’ by Matsumoto Seichyo, I thought it was about Hansen’s disease. Is it right?”

“Yes, it was.”

“I see. I wonder why the disease is so frightening, why you have to kill others to erase your past? I do not understand. And I thought the disease could be more terrible than ‘Ebola virus disease.’”

“They used to call it ‘leprosy,’ now the name has changed to ‘Hansen’s disease’.”

“What are the symptoms?”

“It is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The risk of bacterial infection is quite low, and it is said that the infection occurs in early childhood. You understand the difference between getting sick and getting infected, don’t you? It depends on your physical condition whether you get sick or not if you are infected. Development depends on nutritional status, changes in physical condition and immunity as a result. The characteristic of the disease is a long incubation period of several years, which is different from other infectious diseases. Have you noticed any features on the faces or hands of the people you’ve met today?”

“Yes, I did.”

“The patients today are not suffering because of good medicine, but these features are the aftereffects of the disease in the days when there was no special medicine. Basically, there are two types of Hansen’s disease: ‘leprosy’ and ‘tuberculoid leprosy’. In the past, it used to cause sensory anesthesia or motor nerve along with the progress of the disease, sometimes hair or eyebrows fall out or edema appears on the face depending on the symptoms. These functional disorders of the limbs and the ugliness of the appearance were associated with religious views and began to have a strong persuasive power on people to shape their consciousness. Before we know it, ‘peculiar view against Hansen’s disease’ developed a life of its own, spread widely, and it resulted in the establishment of social consciousness to target the patients of Hansen’s disease to be excluded.”

My son listened to me attentively.

Then we came to the eastern end of Tama Zenshoen, where the greenery was thick. There was a stupa standing still, as if embraced by the trees.

“Father, where are we now?”

“This is the ossuary.”

“Is this the public ossuary of Higashimurayama City?”

“No, it isn’t. This is for those who died in the sanatorium.”

“Their ahes weren’t supposed to be buried in their graves in their hometowns?”

“No, they weren’t. They were not allowed to return to their hometowns even after they died. They keep more than 3600 ahes here. A group of urns, more than 23000, are wandering around the Hansen’s disease sanatoriums all over the country, weeping."

“...”

“The late Mr. Shimada Hitoshi sent me his collection of poems, ‘Next Winter,’ as his will, which includes a wonderful piece called ‘Mona Lisa.’ Let me read it to you."

> There is poison in the smile of Mona Lisa.  
> They say that Leonardo da Vinci  
> Put the danger of knowing everything  
> Into his paintings.
>
> The one who was stolen his laughter from his face  
> In Counting the things she had lost  
> His fingers became crooked
>
> A man unable to live the granted life  
> Becomes clumsy even in weeping  
> Such words emerge from his mouth  
> “Why did you bring me into the world?”
>
> Oh, Mother,  
> Please forgive me for sitting in darkness  
> Leonard,  
> Indeed, you lived too early in the age.

My son stood still with his shaking body.

“Father, please wait a moment. I’m going to buy some incense and flowers.”

## Threads of Perception

It has been more than forty years since my sensation from both elbows to fingertips and from my left knee to the tips of my toes was completely lost.

The signals from the peripheral nerves that make the human body feel pain, hot, cold, or soft, the “threads of perception,” were cut off by the after-effects of Hansen’s disease.

My sense of sight has to run around all the time. The gray area to me, such as “warmth or softness” is granted the extension of short time, but the signals of danger, such as “pain and hotness” must be immediately transmitted to the brain and a defense system must be set up.

This fear, this loss of perception, is constantly attacking me.

There was a knock on the door and Mr. Asuke popped his face out of it.

“Director Iha, it’s tea time. How about coming to the office?

Was it his consideration for me, who had been remarkably quiet these days? The tea, usually brought to my room, was served in the middle of the seats for everyone in the General Affairs Department.

The room was lively with six ladies

“Oh, no! Today I was groped again. Why does he do such a stupid thing... I can’t forgive them anymore! Next time I’m going to turn them over to the police.”

“This is why I hate rush hour trains! I hope the colony adjusts to staggered work hours.”

The short break was spent talking about the groper who had attacked Ms. Kimura, who had just joined the company that year.

“Let me ask you, Manager Iha. Have you ever had such an impulse?” Mr. Kimura asked me with a straight face.

“Men are all the same. Aren’t they, Manager?”

“Well...”

I had to give her a vague answer with a bitter smile on my face.

----- impulse to grope? Come to think of it, my hands have never practiced mischief ------ first of all, my hands have lost the certain sense of touch.

“Director, your white blood cell count is abnormal. There is an inflammation somewhere in your body. Don’t you have any subjective symptoms? Please get checked again.”

The contract doctor Matsumura looked worried in front of the medical examination data in the fall.

“I see. I’ll try to arrange my schedule.”

“Please do it as soon as possible. I understand you’re busy.”

“I will.”

-----The time has finally come.

The blood blister on the bottom of my left foot at the end of last year had grown to the point of inflammation and was almost at its limit.

Even the short distance of walking caused the blood blister on some point of the left foot sole, which is cornified and thickened by the pressure of weight. Usually, the blood blister hardens after several days of rest. But this time I could not even have those several days of rest. The inflammation became bigger and deeper.

----- Long-term rest treatment? ...What should I do?...

The collapse of the bubble economy was a blow to Tokyo Colony’s business. Under the business situation at that time, I had to lead the group as the head to overcome the difficulty.

-----Living of 800 employees?

-----Staying in the hospital for 3 to 4 months under this situation?

These questions tormented me for several months.

I stared at my deformed left leg, red and swollen, and thought to myself.

-----Forty years...you have supported me well!

I was filled with love for my leg.

-----Now, it is impossible for me to run after two rabbits. I have run and run so far. Even for my leg, for a while...

I chose to rest. To do that, I had to make the decision to retire.

Looking back over the last 40 years since I was diagnosed with Hansen’s disease, there was "the separation," "the restoration of function," "the struggles against prejudice and discrimination," and "the responsibilities of leadership..." none of them were easy. But each problem had subsided within my efforts.

However, only ‘the pressure of the fear of losing my perception’ sometimes exceeded “the limit of my effort”. It played mercilessly with my life. This struggle might last until “the end of my life.”

In my 26 years of working life, I have had four long-term treatments for perforating ulcers on my left foot. All of them required surgery with skin grafts, and each time I was away from my business for several months.

I could have used the Hansen’s Disease Sanatorium bed at any time if I had accepted the benefit(?) of the Hansen’s Disease Protection Act, but I did not dare to choose it.

-----I am the one who recovered from Hansen’s disease, and my external wounds caused by the after-effects should be treated in general medical institutions with health insurance coverage.

I did not want to make this principle vague. Each time, Dr. Hashizume and Dr. Nairta offered me a bed in the general hospital.

In general, people tend to think that a disorder caused by a lack of function is a problem that can be solved by a preventive method. However, it was always a struggle on the edge for me to prevent numbness of perception.

It is still my unsolved problem to obtain the perfect net coverage for the functional shift of the perceptual impairment by sight. To cope with this difficulty, it required my full visual concentration to continue. Sometimes the net was torn.

I was always under the pressure of fear and anxiety. It was as if only the dullness of the cloudy sky surrounded me.

Man is too careless with the gratitude of the gift of “perception”, which is transmitted unconsciously through the peripheral nerves that are innate to man.

I sometimes dream of what would happen if...

If heaven would grant me one wish, I would not hesitate to choose...

----- I would like to feel with my fingers the pain that makes me jump, I would like to catch with my palm the heat and the softness, and also the warmth of people.

The room of Dr. Narita, the honorary director, had only an office desk and a chair for visitors, and was not wide enough to move around easily.

“You look busy as usual.”

“Various tasks. Miscellaneous. Such as Bethlehem Hospital, Prince Takamatsu Memorial Hall, and Tama Zenshoen. A day passes in a flash.”

“I have decided to resign from Tokyo Colony."

“Do you? I appreciate your service for many years.”

“I was able to do it because of your help. Thank you very much.”

“Oh no. I did not help you that much. I always wonder how much I could have empathized with you patients as a doctor. People can bear the suffering of others for a long time. It is the same with doctors. We often realize this in our later years. You may not have heard it, but the functions of your limbs, which are unusual, were screaming in the struggle with society, so the doctor only felt compassion for the screaming of your damaged part. We are not getting to the point of confronting the patient’s mind. And what are you going to do from now on?”

“I will let my leg rest. Besides, it will be a good opportunity for me to write about Hansen’s disease."

“How nice. The history of Hansen’s disease is like a long and dark tunnel. There is no light to see through.”

“Absolutely.”

“Very nice. I hope it will be something to illuminate its history, not written with our imagination.”

## Kagiyadefuu (Ryukyuan Dance for a Feast)

In January 1994, I returned home with my wife Shigeko.

“Are you sure of your memory of 40 years ago?”

Her voice was anxious, knowing my usual lack of knowledge of the country.

“Well, somewhere around here, I think. The man I asked for directions told me that Inabusumō was that hill. No doubt. We looked over Inabusumō right in front of our house.”

“Don’t forget to be home by six o’clock.”

My brother handed me a piece of paper with the address ‘212 Aza-Nakasone Nakijin-son’ written on it.

We found two old houses, each with a gate marked ‘212-1 and 212-2’.

“Shigeko, here it is! It’s right here!”

The old houses in Nakijin-son and its hibiscus hedge have been turned into a concrete block wall.

“There used to be a tall chinaberry tree in the garden, but it was cut down... I was tied and hanged from it whenever I did wrong...

The hedge in my distant memory was neatly trimmed and between the branches were red petals with morning dew in full bloom.

The fallen chinaberry petals formed a red band along the hedge. It was my job to clean up the yard, and somehow I enjoyed sweeping the long line of the belt with a bamboo broom.

“Let’s climb up the Inabusumō over there.”

The memory of my childhood prompted me to climb the hill, but it took less than 10 minutes to get the top of the hill. The ground had been leveled and changed into a Japanese croquet field. There was not a soul to be seen as it was early afternoon.

“There used to be big pine trees surrounding the hill here and there. But they are gone...”

We looked down at the row of houses below, reflecting the white light.

“Nice place!”

“Shigeko, you can see right below my old residence that we visited a few minutes ago.”

“...”

“After dinner, my father used to play Chindami, which is Sanshin in the Okinawan dialect. My family all gathered in the living room and listened to the sound of Chindami, surrounding our father, who was sitting on his back on the Buddhist altar. My grandmother and sisters sat on the left side, and my mother sat near the kitchen. We did not listen respectfully to his playing. My sisters were playing string games, my elder brother Yoshiyasu and I were resting our chins in our hands, and high school student, elder brother Okinori was reading a book. But no one spoke during this time. A bare 80-watt bulb hung in the center of the 3.6-meter-wide celling, and lying under the light, I could see the moonlight over Inabusumo creeping into the porch. And only the sound of Sanshin and his voice surrounded our family...”

“When did your father die?”

“It was February 20, 1979. He was 82 years old. It was 15 years ago.”

When we returned to my parents’ house in Gushigawa, the entrance was crowded with many shoes.

My nephew said in a loud voice, “My uncle and aunts are back!”

We were ushered into the room and greeted with great applause.

“Congratulations on your marriage.”

Akiko, my nephew shyly handed us a bunch of flowers.

Shigeko and I were embarrassed by the unexpected situation.

The living room was wide open and there were 41 members of the whole family, from my mother, brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces, and there hung on the alcove “Congratulations on your marriage” written in Indian ink. It was all planned without our knowledge.

As we took our seats, the noise of 41 people quickly disappeared.

My elder brother began to play the sanshin and sing in front of us. Two kotos (traditional Japanese harp) followed the sound. They were Kimiko, my brother’s wife, and Kinko, their daughter, who played the strings with her left hand sliding across the strings.

My father’s sanshin was placed on the Japanese cushion next to my brother.

Elder sister Atuko and younger sister Chieko came out from the left side of the stage and began to dance.

It was ‘‘Kagiyadefuu[^1]”

> What can we compare with  
> The happiness of today  
> It is like flowers in buds  
> Opening in the morning dew.

“Ah, how I wish I could have swung the souls of Ryou and Yui in this sound and blood bond."

[^1]: Kagiyadefuu Bushi(Tune)’ is the dance performed at the opening of happy celebrations. Also called ‘Gujinfuu’. It is named after the music played in front of the Ryukyu king. There are five imperial tunes: ‘Unnna-bushi’, ‘Nagaiheya Bushi’,‘Nakagusukuhantame Bushi’, ‘Kotei Bushi’ and ‘Kagiyadefuu-Bushi’

## The Family

“It’s unfair to take only Ryo to Okinawa. I want to go with you.”

“I think I’ll take you to Okinawa to celebrate your coming of age. I’ll be back in Okinawa in April to gather some information, so let’s do it then.”

“Really? That’s great! With Aunty Shigeko? Very nice.”

Yui was excited about the hastily decided homecoming of the three of us. Our plan was immediately announced to my parents.

My mother couldn’t have been happier on the phone.

“Finally... I can see my grandchildren for the first time before I die. I can’t wait for that day...”

However, the plan was going to be uncertain. Suddenly a nurse, one of Shigeko’s co-workers, fell ill, robbing Shigeko of her vacation.

“We simply cannot arrange for a replacement. I am sorry, but please take only Yui with you.”

“It can’t be helped. Then I will.”

I called my brother and told him that the two of us, me and my daughter, would be there.

“Hello, Shigeko cannot join us and Yui and I will go back.”

“Can’t you change your schedule to suit her?”

“There are reasons for gathering information. Besides, Yui cannot change her schedule.”

“...”

The next day, my brother told me the message from my mother.

“She says, ‘Absolutely not!’...she is furious and won’t give an inch, saying, ‘Toshio is wrong. If only two come home, I won’t let them into my house.’ What are you going to do?”

It was an unexpected scolding from my mother. However, I could not understand the true meaning of her words. She was so happy. What had happened?

I had no choice but to persuade Yui and made her give up going to Okinawa this time and decided to go alone to gather information.

After the homecoming greeting at the Buddhist altar, I sat face to face with my mother.

“Yoshiyasu and Toshio, come here and sit down...”

Her face was unusually stern.

“Toshio, I need to tell you something. Did you understand the meaning of what I told you the other day?”

“...”

“You are spoiled too much by Shigeko. Why can’t you have more compassion for women’s feelings?

Since you had such a separation from your children, you must have thought about it a lot. Not to mention that you can see each other now, it would be even more for you. But whatever the situation was, it was you who broke the bond between you and your children, for whatever reason. And yet you are acting as their father and experiencing the nature of a parent. You cannot have a parent-child relationship where Shigeko is out of the loop. Toshio, from now on, you should think of Shigeko first with all your heart. This is not a parent-child relationship! Visiting your parents’ house with two children? When you came back with Ryo five years ago, you hid your divorce from me. You had no choice then... No, you don’t understand! Fortunately, Shigeko became one of our children through a good match. Maybe Shigeko wanted to send you both away with all her heart. But I will not allow it!”

“...”

“How can any old people not want to see his grandchildren? If you stray from the right path, I will have to throw away my grandchildren! Then the only one left for me to choose will be Shigeko.”

“...”

“Yoshiyasu! Why couldn’t you tell your younger brother the principle of things? before you heard from me?”

“...”

“Now that you are both here, I have to tell you one more thing. It’s about Toshio’s divorce 16 years ago. You may think it is an old story. But how dare you cheat on your parents for 13 years? I heard it was decided after consultation among seven brothers and sisters. Not to make me sad for Toshio, whom I love the most, and not to tell me before I die? That’s also unacceptable! Such shallow thinking on your part. It turns out that I made Toshio feel sad whenever he came home. In other words, I made Toshio bring souvenirs for Ryo and Yui without any recipients. And that’s for 13 years. When Toshio needed help the most, I was of no use to him. You all betrayed me until shortly before he married Shigeko again...”

“...”

“Yoshiyasu, Toshio, remember, the family is always together, no matter what happens to us.”

The smell of incense was all around us.

“...Whether we cry or laugh... This is the family.”

-----The Family ----- As I recall, it was as if I had been on a continuous journey to find my family since I was diagnosed with Hansen’s disease...

“...Whether crying or laughing...this is the family.”

-----The Family ----- When I think about it, it was as if I have been on a continuous journey to find my family since I was diagnosed with Hansen’s disease.

(The End)
