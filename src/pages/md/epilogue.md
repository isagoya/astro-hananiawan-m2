It is called a false accusation to be imprisoned for an innocent crime.

The history of Hansen's disease (leprosy) in Japan has exactly been one of exclusion and eradication. Patients were accused of "forced isolation" and imprisoned for life simply because the diagnosis was unfortunately "Hansen's disease".

Who judged it was the prejudice born of the moral sense against an incurable disease that was thought to be the result of bad karma. And it based its great cause on "public sanitation. The name of the law was "Leprosy Prevention Law" and the crime was "Hansen's Disease". The punishment was imprisonment until death. But more than 5500 people had survived in the place of exile called Hansen's Sanatoriums.

Man, humiliated man, patients were abandoned for the sake of the majority, and their families were neglected under groundless "stigma. This situation still exists in modern Japan, which enjoys its prosperity.

In 1996, the Ministry of Health and Welfare admitted its mistakes in administering Hansen's disease and closed the curtain on its 89-year history. However, they did not attempt to investigate the stains committed by the medical administration.

The way home of the sorrows and bitter feelings of those who have been abandoned by society, expelled from their hometowns and cut off from their families has been erased by the passage of too long a period of time.

More than 23,000 of the remains are sleeping in sanatoriums, and even the places where their spirits are to return have not been found to this day.

When Hansen's disease is diagnosed, patients and their families curse their fate: "Why only us? Some take their own lives on the brink of despair, others intensify their spirituality and, in resignation, try to find salvation in the world of religion or art. Cured people also close their mouths and hold their breath, erase their past as much as possible, and try to live mixed in society.

The meaning of existence is given to everyone at birth. Just having fair and free dreams and realizing them could be called the activity of human beings. But sometimes illness brings many frustrations and sufferings to people. The medical battle is the cross sword with the things that drive people to despair and suffering. But although medicine has destroyed germs, "Hansen's disease" was an exception.

The medical administration and social stigma in Japan killed Hansen's disease patients. And they killed them alive.

What in the world could "Hansen's disease" be?

For me, dealing with Hansen's disease and living my life have been synonymous since the outbreak of the disease when I was 14 years old.

The cloudless soul and hope had given to me as well. But in my reality, along with going through "Hansen's disease," they were being peeled off one by one.

When I got lost and almost lost sight of other people, there were always meetings with many people who supported me. And each time it was these people who gave me peace of mind and showed me the way. For me, people are the "flowers" themselves.

It was people who killed people, but it was also people who kept people alive and healed people.

The title of this book, " Aspire to Meet Flowers", was named after his last the haiku (Japanese poem) by Dan Kazuo; "Mogaribue, how many nights to blow aspiring to meet flowers". His posthumous work was "Kataku no Hito".

When the disease is cured, I want to live a normal life in society. It was 27 years ago and it was from this little wish that I decided to go on living and to announce myself as "recovered from Hansen's disease", but perhaps the time was not yet ripe, I had to go along with many frustrations and sacrifices.

My greatest regret was the loss of three members of my family. After all, my challenge to punch a hole in a solid wall only opened a narrow path for me to get out, not wide enough for the four of us to walk through hand in hand.

I was born in Okinawa, suffered from Hansen's disease, and worked for 26 years in the social welfare field, dealing with the employment problem of disabled people.

There has always been the issue of "minorities" in my life.

As a result, without even knowing it, I have acquired a habit in my basic points of thought.

It is "not the pain of the foot that has stepped on the stone, but the pain of the stone that has been stepped on".

How did the storm that announced itself as Hansen's disease blow through most of my life?

I am reminded of my immature ability in writing expression with this theme before me. Can I summarize the facts as objectively and dispassionately as possible? As I continued to write, this task was accompanied by much suffering. It was because the foolish temptation to glorify myself overflowed between the lines.

It is also the responsibility, as the one who had suffered and cried from the disease, to leave the "History of Hansen's Disease Patients", through the 45years of my life, which is going to be forgotten and be concealed.

The society killed person. I want to tell the fact to as many people as possible. Also, not to repeat the same grief again in the society where people live together.

With two supplements, "About Face" and "The Silence of Damien," I referred to the problems on the historical, social, and religious problems of Hansen's disease. They are added to help readers better understand of the background of the main story.

I owe many thanks to those who helped me to publish this book. More, I thank once again to many people who took part in the interviews.

I dedicate this book to my mother who was born in 1904, and now 92 years old.
