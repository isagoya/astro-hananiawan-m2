## Ripples

 January 1970. I finished my training period and received my first salary. It was 22,000 yen. Finally, my hard-earned money was in the envelope. That night I wrote to Akiko. By that time, she had graduated from the Higher Nursing School attached to National Tama Zenshoen, and went straight working for Hansen's Disease Sanatorium.

Until then, I had met her several times while I was a student at Central Labor Academy (Chūōrōdō Gakuin), but I had only bowed slightly and dared not speak to her.

 “Dear Akiko, I have finally been able to work and live on my own. The conditions of three years ago, when you turned down to have friendly relationship with me, are now resolved. Here is my formal proposal to you...”

 On Sunday of the following week I wrote to Akiko, who visited me at the colony.

 “You made it. Congratulations!”

After about a year and a half of friendship, the day had come to ask Akiko's father for permission of wedding.

 The June rain lasted four days. Akiko and her father were already sitting across from each other in her dormitory room, which I visited for the first time. After the first greeting, her father stared at me intensely, and I felt as if the sound of the rain outside, coming through the window glass, was also accusing me.

 “When Akiko said she wanted to go to nursing school for Hansen's disease, I could not say no. Poverty is indeed a pitiful thing...I had no word to answer in front of my daughter, who cares about her parents' economy even in her own choice of the future. That was the beginning of her stumbling. But this proposal made her make the worst choice of all.”

I was impatient to find my words. My mouth dried up and the words I had prepared in my head did not come out except “Um-”. Even though Akiko had poked me in the knee, my words lost their place and ran around my body in front of her father, who crossed his arms, squared his shoulders and turned his face away from me.

“Toshio is living his life to the fullest. Father, you always told me that the value of a man is his single-mindedness...”

 Listening to Akiko's challenging voice, I just stared into her father's eyes.

“Such as a temporary passion...the world is not so easy.”

 “I have neither money nor social status. But I'll take care of her with all my heart. We will try to work together for our happiness. I'm begging you...”

 That was all I could say. The conversation among the three stopped and I felt the air in the room turned into a solid form.

 There was a knock on the door.

 “Excuse me, Akiko, your tea is getting cold. Let me make another one.”

 “Thank you. Let me introduce my father. Dad, this is Ms. Fujisawa, my roommate.”

 Her father smiled broadly.

 “Thank you for always taking care of my daughter.”

 After refilling the tea, Ms. Fujisawa made a small fist at Akiko with her back turned, and Akiko replied with a nod.

 “Such a long rain slows down the drying of the poured concrete. Mom's stress is growing. They finally finished the soil retention of the back mountain.”

 “Has the village government approved the disaster relief work?”

“Yes, but bureaucratic work takes a long time. It's been a year. It will be a relief for Mom.”

 The father and daughter continued to talk about their hometown. I watched the second hand of the alarm clock on the table.

 None of the words I had prepared to say took shape.

 How many times did I repeat, “I am begging you.”

 It had been two hours since the three of us sat face to face.

 Akiko's father grabbed a cup with both hands and emptied it in one gulp, then took a deep breath and said bluntly.

“I don't care, even if you two die in a ditch... Do whatever you want.”

We bowed our heads deeply before him.

We were to be married on September 12, 1971.

 Akiko's parents, who had said, “We will allow the marriage but not attend the wedding,” had come from Kagoshima. Of course, my parents came from Okinawa, accompanied by Yutaka, my brother-in-law.

 The night before the wedding, we had dinner at the inn in front of Yoyogi Station, with both parents present. Akiko's father, however, got drunk and started hurling sharp words at my father.

“Mr. Iha, Dogenkotsudesuka (how do you think?). There are no parents in Kagoshima who don’t not pay a visit to the girl's parents asking their son's permission to marry their daughter...No, no one...”

 “I am very sorry. I am such a father who once abandoned my son because of his illness. As such a father, how can I ask you to give your daughter in marriage to my son? I am truly sorry...”

My father looked down and clenched his fists.

----- I thought to myself: This is what it was.

I remembered his words when he took me to the Hansen's disease sanatorium fourteen years ago.

“Toshio, there are many brothers here. They are all small, but...”

----- Abandoned his son?

 His words of at that time...

 Was he mumbling to himself?

Our wedding ceremony was held by Mr. and Mrs. Nomura as matchmakers, and “The Committee Celebrating the New Departure" sponsored the party with its 1,000yen participation fee.

“I have refused the matchmaker's request as far as possible, but this case is exceptional. The world is a strange place, isn't it? Dr. Hashizume Chozo, who performed an orthopedic surgery on Mr. Iha, is my old friend and our mutual friend. I served as the matchmaker for my old friend, and Mr. Iha served as the host that day.”

Our greeting was very tense.

“Hansen's disease became the tie that bound us together. One suffers from it, the other cares for it, and we talked about discrimination, our way of life, and decided to get married. We are not old enough to talk about our past. On the other hand, the price of our youth was not so low as to forget the tears and anger of the past. It is said that birds singing in the spring know the sword of cold in the winter wind. We begin our new life in the goodwill of all of you.”

 From the wedding speeches we can learn how the couple between a former Hansen's disease patient and a staff of the sanatorium created ripples around.

> A man suffering from Hansen's disease and a woman caring for him will be married with the blessing of their parents. They will be married with the praise of their teachers and many friends from their past.  
> They will build their castle of transparent love and another layer of love around them. Many minds, groaning under unjustified prejudice and discrimination, stick through the couple with one direction.  
> (Shirabe Kazuoki, current president of Tokyo Colony)
>
> The people who turned our questions into determination, our loneliness into searing heat.  
> The people who prepared us for change,  
> The people who led us to the wider world of action, to the joy of being alive and the passion of gratitude and compassion for those who kept us alive and nurtured us from the deep abyss of questioning why we are alive and why we were born.  
> Please observe the height of the flame of the corona into which we are growing.  
> In response to the thousands of suns circling to support the turning point  of our lives.  
> Please empower us with your living traditions for our willingness to keep burning!  
> (Shimada Hitoshi, Hansen’s Poets Group)

## Human Archipelago (NHK TV Program)

 It was November 1971 when Mr. Tomizawa Mitsuru, one of the producers of NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), visited me. At that time, he was involved in documentary programs, and his products were selected one after another as the best work of the year.

“I was reporting on Hansen's disease, when Ms. Sato, the case worker at Zenshoen, introduced me to you.”

 I met him only twice, and he spoke to me haltingly, but we immediately became kindred spirits.

-----To make the documentary about the prejudice and discrimination against Hansen's disease as it is. Appeal through all the real people -----

“Mr. Iha, won't you make your appeal for 30 minutes in the nationwide NHK program?”

And so began work on the documentary “Human Archipelago; A Certain Marriage,” which was to be broadcast in December.

 Akiko had vehemently objected.

 “For you, it may be the argument of a way of life. But for me, it is nothing more than a marriage with one person. Why is that so special?”

But I finally got her to agree on the condition that it would be only this time.

 For two months, three TV crews closely followed our daily life. The filming went smoothly.

 To shoot the scene, I visited Nagashima Aiseien in Okayama with the TV crews, where I had spent my high school days. They were so welcoming that the office manager himself met us at Okayama Station.

 “We received the information from the Central Broadcasting Station in Tokyo. Thank you for coming all this way.

 However, in the entrance hall of Nagashima Aiseien, they immediately began to argue.

 “Mr. Iha, please do not enter the facility from here. We have specially arranged for you to stay in the patient area.”

 Mr. Tomizawa, who was usually calm, raised his voice.

 “Why is that? That's a problem. This time, our purpose is to provide close coverage. Then we will stay there with Mr. Iha.”

“Oh no, that is not allowed.  Mr. Iha is the former patient. Besides, we have no precedent since the establishment of the sanatorium to let the recovered person enter this main office building.”

Suddenly, Mr. Yoshimura, the videographer, started filming their exchange.

 “Wait. Wait a minute. Don't roll the camera...”

Then they asked us to give them some time and began to discuss the matter, putting their heads together. We were held at the entrance for about 30 minutes.

Finally, the TV crew and I were allowed to enter the meeting room in the main building of Nagashima Aiseien. I was also allowed to stay at the Koufū Inn, which was for guests only, and eat at the cafeteria, which was for staff only.

“Mr. Yoshimura, you did a good job rolling your camera at that time. It was good timing.”

“Oh no. The camera had no film then.”

“Human Archipelago, A Certain Marriage” was to be aired in TV commercials and introduced in the TV guides of newspapers as a controversial work.

I sat in front of the TV set with Akiko and waited for the show to start. The title “Human Archipelago” came on.

 “What is this? No, that's wrong...”

The caption below the screen began, “The program 'A Certain Marriage' has been canceled for some reason. We will broadcast the previous program...”

 After the substitute program for “Human Archipelago” was over, Mr. Tomizawa called us.

 “I am very sorry. It was my lack of ability...”

 There were no other words. For some reason, I was able to understand everything from his short words. That there was some kind of pressure on him and that he refused to compromise until the end...

The next morning, I went to my office and was busy answering telephone interviews that were ringing off the hook.

 “This is Mr. Suzuki from the social affairs department of Paper A.”

“This is Mr. Ogawa from the social affairs department of Paper B.”

 “I wonder why the news reporter from the social affairs department is bringing up the issue of canceling the TV program?

 “Why did you suggest the cancellation just before the broadcast? Could I visit you and hear your story from you?”

“Suggesting cancellation? Who did that? Did NHK's public relations department announce it? No, I don't know. In today's morning paper? No, I haven't read it yet...”

 I asked someone to bring the paper quickly. The article was on the social page, the space below.

-----The broadcast of “A Certain Marriage,” which was the first to deal with Hansen's disease, was canceled due to the person's own suggestion shortly before the broadcast. At 10:00 in the morning, two black hired cars pulled up in the colony's courtyard.

 The executives of NHK, the Liberal Arts Section, the Public Relations Section and the Program Organization Section arrived and asked to speak with me.

“First of all, we are here to apologize for your inconvenience.”

“To begin with, I'd like to ask you what does it mean, 'Canceled due to the person's own suggestion'”

 “The newspaper media misinterpreted our article and wrote it down. We are very sorry. As for NHK, we are preparing an alternative to the cancellation. We are planning to have a special medical program in the educational broadcast, the purpose of which is to get rid of prejudices. We very much hope you to understand”.

 All three of them repeated it again and again, bowing their heads.

 I refused their request. In several of our meetings, the fact of the cancellation came out to my persecution.

 On the day of the broadcast, a Hansen's disease survivor, accompanied by a representative, visited NHK.

 “If the program is broadcast, we who live our lives hiding our past will be exposed to the world. And then we cannot go on with our lives as before. If we are affected after the broadcast, we will ask for compensation. I urge you to stop the broadcast at all costs.”

They said that the meeting was not settled until just before the airing. Finally, time ran out, and NHK decided to cancel the broadcast, worried about the predicted social reaction.

 “As for NHK, we will do our best to get rid of prejudices, so could you please understand?”

 They kept repeating the same words.

 “Prejudice is social consciousness toward people. That's why you focused the camera on me, the real being, right?

 They accompanied Mr. N., the former Hansen's disease patient's representative, on their fourth visit.

 After exchanging name cards, Mr. N., who called himself the group leader, stared at me and opened his mouth.

 “Mr. Iha, since you are one of those recovering from Hansen's disease, you know our agony well. Could you please have consideration for your friends who live quietly?

 “What do you mean by consideration?

“We are going to be in a bad way when people talk about Hansen's disease. Especially if your crippled hands are shown on the screen, the lives of people who have returned to society with their aftereffects will be frightened. So please agree with us to cancel the broadcast this time.

“You know, our illness is cured.”

 “It is, medically. But not yet socially. Mr. Iha, it has only been a year since you came back socially. You do not understand the real agony of recovering from Hansen's disease... If our lives would be affected by the broadcast of this time, we must take appropriate measures.

 “What do you mean by appropriate measures? Something like compensation?”

 “That includes”

“Who are you asking for? Is it against NHK or against me?”

 “We will judge it comprehensively...”

 “Mr. N., I refuse your request. While you are talking about damages that can be predicted after the broadcast, I have already suffered damages by canceling the broadcast due to your pressure. If we are talking about damages, I am the one who should claim them, not you.

 I turned to the NHK employees who were sitting with us.

“If you NHK is going to start new educational program, it will be very significant by itself, so I hope you will do the great job. But it is not logical to offer it in exchange for canceling the program about me. I insist that you broadcast 'A Certain Marriage.'“

 I continued to insist that the program be broadcast.

 In March of the following year, the document “A Certain Marriage” was finally broadcast as the last episode of “Human Archipelago.” The next day, Mr. Ishii, the landlord of our apartment, visited us.

 “I was watching TV. It was very nice... By chance, Mr. K. called me and I was on my way back. I wondered whether I should tell you or not. But Mr. K. said, “It seems that Mr. Iha is the one who recovered from Hansen's disease. I want you to evict him from this apartment because I don't want to live in the same apartment with him. And I refused such an unreasonable request. Then he said, 'If you don't do this, we're leaving. When he said that, there was no way, so we dissolved the contract...”

 “I'm sorry about that.”

 “No, no. Please let me know if I can help you in any way.”

 After the broadcast, the promise between Akiko and me was never kept. Because we were swarmed by the mass media. I put too much strain on myself and lost sight of my concern for the heart of my wife. I was overexcited and felt like a knight in the fight against prejudice and discrimination against Hansen's disease.

## Quicksand

While the filming of “A Certain Marriage” was going smoothly, Akiko went on maternity leave. And then our environment became noisy.

 One day I came home and found Akiko with her head on the table, crying. It seemed she had two visitors, and there were two teacups of leftover drinks.

 “What is it? What happened?”

 She sniffled for a while and finally opened her mouth.

The two visitors were operating committee members from the company's child care center.

-----According to her, they had planned to visit her before I came home, so that they could have a quiet talk without me.

“What did they say to you?”

“I wonder if we were wrong. They suddenly told me, 'Akiko, are you really going to have a baby? You know, they're involved in medical care, too, right? To our baby to be born in the future -- I said, 'Yes, I will give birth to a fine baby! Guess what they said? Are you going to leave your child to our nursery? If that happens, our center, which was built through the hard work of the union and local mothers, will be destroyed because of your selfishness. Please, you two do not make working mothers suffer...”

 “What! How did you answer them?”

 “Of course, I asked them to take care of my baby after my maternity leave is over...”

 We immediately had a conversation with two committee members.

 “Our nursery is finally on the right track. The workers at the sanatorium have no problem. They know about Hansen's disease. However, two-thirds of the people who use our nursery are neighbors who do not know about Hansen's disease. Many of them are against using the same nursery with a child whose parent has recovered from Hansen's disease. If they stop using our nursery, our economic management won't work. So we want you not to leave your baby with us.”

Even though we had expected some reaction regarding the day care of our newborn, when we knew it was as we had expected, the only ray of light would fade.

 “Just wait. Giving our baby to your center is not just for breastfeeding. We just want to raise our child normally. The nursery has its existence value because all the children grow up together, doesn't it? We don't want to hire a private nurse to take care of our child. Besides, I have recovered from my illness. The medical facility where you work has verified that I've recovered and let me go back to work. Why can't his child take advantage of the company's daycare center?”

“It is not the medical issue. It's the emotional problem.”

The private negotiations made little progress. The delivery date was approaching. I hurried to settle the matter so that my wife could give birth with a peaceful mind.

 We held a meeting of the Parents' Association with Dr. Arai, Ms. Sato, the caseworker, and two of us.

-----In spite of our child was not yet born, we were to discuss whether or not to send the baby to the nursery. I joined them, but I could not get rid of my feeling that something was wrong. There was a heated debate between the doctor and the leaders. But what surprised me was that the most of sanatorium staff was against it.

Suddenly, Mr. C., one of the sanatorium staff, who was drunk, came into the room and shouted in a loud voice.

“You won't accept Mr. Iha's child because of the opposition of parents other than the sanatorium staff? That's a damned lie! It is you, the sanatorium staff, who are objecting. Don't make me laugh. The union that protects the interests of the workers, huh? Akiko, hold on. I'll be on your side, even if it's just me!”

The union officials who moderated the meeting turned pale at the sudden statement of the intruder. After that, the situation of the meeting changed completely.

Then the parents' association voted by an overwhelming majority to admit our child to the nursery.

 Provided that they asked me to make a firm promise that I would never set foot in the patient area of the facility again. I agreed to their request and bowed my head to them.

 “Please take care of my child.”

 Akiko was in tears on our way home.

“Why did you accept this unreasonable request not to go into the patient area? Do you think going in and out of the patient area will cause Hansen's disease infection?

Also, why did you bow and ask for our children's acceptance?

I am a member of the union! I have the right to use the nursery at work.”

On July 2, 1972, we had our first baby. I named him Ryo.

 After Akiko's maternity leave was over, he was left to the nursery school. However, some parents still refused to let their children take naps next to Ryo, or refused to let their children wear Ryo's clothes even when the nursery ran out of changing clothes.

 After twelve years, Mr. M., who had retired from the kindergarten, visited me at Tokyo Colony. The receptionist told me about his visit, and when I invited him into the meeting room, he suddenly put his hands on the floor and cried.

“It has been a long time. I really wanted to meet you and apologize. I was very sorry for you. We should have been more resolute then. There is no regret enough. I know I hurt Ryo's heart. I couldn't refuse the demands of some of the parents... I am ashamed of it. I will regret it for the rest of my life."

 Two faces that opposed Ryo's entry into the nursery overlapped with Mr. M., who bowed his head in front of me.

 Yui, our daughter who was born three years later, had no problem using the same nursery. Later, it was expanded to accommodate the growing number of users.

There were only two days left in 1972. Akiko stared intensely at one point of the celling.

 “Dad, let's go and see the Holly House that has just been finished. I am moving into Holly House no matter what happens!”

 They built the staff-only apartment for six families next to the Tama Zenshoen. It consisted of two rooms with a combined dining/kitchen/bathroom, and the rent was a bargain of 60% compared to private housing. They were recruiting residents at the time of completion.

 “The colony where Akiko's husband works offers small wages, so their life would be hard living in a private apartment.”

Akiko's co-workers had applied for the public recruitment using our names without our knowledge. Their competition rate was more than four times higher. Lucky or unlucky? We found Akiko's name among the winners on the board. But one by one, the applicants declined, and in the end, even the substitute applicant for the fifth room did not come out.

 Half a year passed and we were still the only residents in Holly House. Eventually, the public recruitment was done in a general real estate agency storefront.

 With that as a starting point, the smile disappeared from Akiko's face. After a while, she started pleading with me every time.

 “Dad, please stop saying you're cured of Hansen's disease. It is enough to say that you are only handicapped in your limbs...”

 Our children are growing up. Let's move to some countryside where no one knows your past. Since you are supported by everyone in the colony, you don't understand our real suffering! You always talk about the theory of existence... Please open your eyes and take a good look at reality!  

 Mutual misunderstandings began to occur. Eventually the problem grew to the point where the way of life between us became controversial. The gap between us grew wider and wider.

 We got divorced in August 1980.

 Akiko, Ryo and Yui returned to Kagoshima. Ryo was eight years old. Yui was about to celebrate her fifth birthday.

 On August 7th. I came home and there were no voices of the children who used to jump up at the front door to greet me.

 There was a note from Akiko on the table.

---Thank you for a long time. I will take only happy days with me. As we promised, please do not try to find our destination until the children visit you of their own will...

 The sound of every families of this past eight years had slipped into underground.

 “All alone again...”

## Crests of Waves

It was the early summer of 1983. Suddenly, I wanted to feel the breeze in the birthplace of Dan Fumio’s literature．

 Last year, I walked around Fukugon Temple in Yanagawa City and Nokonoshima Island by myself, but this time I went to Fukuoka, accepting the kind words of Mr. Matsuo, the manager of Zencolo and Fukuoka Colony.

 He said, “This time I will be your guide. Please stay at my house for one night and have a good rest.”

 As the car passed through Ikinomatubara, Nokonoshima appeared again.

 “How did you enjoy Nokonoshima Island last year?”

 “Yes, I visited Dan Kazuo’s second house. There was no sign of anyone living there, but I excused myself and entered the house through the garden. There was a dock below, and I could see Fukuoka City on the opposite shore. I suppose he was driven away by various pains in this landscape...Man can easily endure the pains of disease...Healing from the pains of the heart is more difficult...This house was filled with the passions of three women. Ritsuko, who died, Keiko, who appears in his novel ‘House on Fire’, and his wife. I think he was always closely watched by the three of them and would not fit into that small house.

 “Your way of reading books is always a little different from others…”

I wondered if the fine June weather would keep pumping the seawater up into the sky? The series of landscapes that were distant shadows of islands and cityscapes blurred as if seen through an azure screen.

“You know, we passed the Atago Shrine a while ago. They say she will answer your prayer if you wish to give up something.”

“I don’t have too much to give up yet.”

“You have enough more than you can handle, right? If you wish, shall we go back to Atago Shrine?”

 Mr. Matsuo teased me as usual.

“No, thank you.”

“This is Shikanoshima Island, which juts out to the left and overlaps with Nokonoshima Island. In front is Goishibana. Behind it is Nisiuragasaki, which is hidden from this view, but you can see Genkai Island in the distance.”

The breeze blowing across Imazu Bay hit my face through the open car window.

-----Yes, it was this path. Dan Kazuo had walked towards Oda with Ritsuko’s urn hanging from his waist and Taro on his shoulder.

-----Who would collect my ashes? Suddenly, it came to my mind.

“Shall we stop by Akizuki? It won’t take long on the highway…”

 Akizuki is a castle town in the mountainous region in the northern part of Amagi City. Surrounded by mountains on all sides, the clear river cuts through the central part of the town and was quiet because it was a weekday. We entered the former residence of Lord Kuroda, continued along the cherry trees about 700 meters long, climbed up the stone steps at the end of the cherry trees, the Ohte-mon Gate, called the Black Gate Standing with Arms Akimbo, was proud of its appearance.

 “Our ancestors came from here. Their names are recorded in the Akizuki Folk Museum next door. Strangely, I always feel calm when I come here. This castle ruin is crowded during the cherry blossom season, but it would be nice to be here at the chosen time.”

It was after six o’clock when we returned from Akizuki Castle.

The Matsuo family was a long line of doctors, and the house on the hill overlooked Shingū City from the garden.

His wife greeted me. He had described her as “old-fashioned and unassuming”.

 “I’ve been looking forward to seeing you.”

 I was ushered into the living room where the banquet was being prepared.

“You are almost forty and still want to follow in the footsteps of a man of letters, you are naive despite your appearance. Neither independence nor a house on fire suits you. Are you bewitched by women?”

 I brushed off his words and stared at the cup of local liquor. I had been distracted by the gaze of the Buddha called Amitabha on the alcove, the copy of the fresco wall painting from Hōryūji Temple.

“How long has this painting been there?”

“It’s been here since my grandfather’s time.”

“Then it is older than the current Hōryūji mural, isn’t it?”

“I heard that this is the copy of a famous Japanese artist. It is said that this was my grandfather’s favorite among his collections. It’s almost as if our three generations have been watched the whole inside and outside by this Amitabha. Before the war, in the days when Buddhism was abolished, people brought my grandfather various kinds of art works from unknown sources, and this is one of them that he bought. His collections are still piled up unsorted in the warehouse.

 “Sweet face...”

 “You’re a member of the management, aren’t you? You should be more stubborn. There is nothing more disgusting than a temporary emotion... You are not going all the way...”

“The sound of waves from the Genkai Sea continues for so long!”

 “Do you have any contact with your children?”

 “No, I don’t.”

 “Forget them once and for all. It’s been three years, right? You’d better fall in love sometime. You look like bearing Hansen’s disease on your shoulder all by yourself, but martyrs live a smarter way of life.”

 “Oh, what’s wrong with you? The lights are out. Thank you for coming. My name is Kayoko. I really appreciate your support of my husband.”

 “I’m sorry to barge in and disturb you today.”

 “I’m afraid I can’t offer you hospitality, but please take your time.

 “Thank you very much.”

 “The snapper I ordered to Mr. Urayama of Shinkoumaru, the fishing boat has just arrived.”

 “Bring us another sake. This sake is dry but nice, isn’t it?”

 “Oh, it’s unusual for you to drink so much sake. You’re already drunk on your own. Sorry about that, Mr. Iha. But he has been waiting your visit for several days saying, ‘Finally, Mr. Iha will visit and stay with us.’”

“You ordered the snapper for Mr. Urayama. You’d better learn how to clean a snapper since you married into the Hakata family.”

“How did you like Akizuki Castle?”

“That was nice place.”

“My husband was eager to take you to Akizuki Castle, which is related to the Matuo family, on your visit.”

 “He composed good haiku when I told him that Akizuki is the southern limit of Japanese boxwood.”

“It just came to my mind…”

 “Kayoko, bring me my accessories bag over there. I wrote it down on the notebook so I wouldn’t forget. Here it is.”

 Mr. Matsuo opened his notebook and read my haiku.

>> Moon reflects on black hair combed by boxwood

“It’s beautiful, isn’t it? I wonder if he is in love with someone else. Besides, he is crazy about Dan Kazuo now.”

 “I read your travelogue about Nokonoshima the other day.”

 “Oh, it was something like a memorandum.”

 “Yesterday, he spent the whole day at the Fukuoka Local Museum. He was trying to find out some information about Dan Kazuo that was not available in Tokyo.”

 “Let’s go down to the sea, Iha. Kayoko, we’ll have another drink when we get back.”

 “Oh, are you okay…being that drunk?”

Even though he had drunk so much, his step was firm.

 We walked down the doglegged road for a while to the fishing port where three boats were moored. After about five minutes of walking, the wharf broke off and we could step onto Shingu Beach. Far ahead, between the waves, the lights of the houses on Ainoshima Island seemed to embrace the happy circle of the fishing village.

 “Where do your children live now?”

 “I don’t know. We promised not to seek their whereabouts until they visit me of their own accord.”

 “It is better for you to forget your children.”

“Uh...”

 “Children grow up without parents, without parents they grow up better... Why not? Remember Dan Kazuo’s last haiku?”

> Mogari Whistle, how many nights to blow in anticipation to meet the flowers…
> Mogari Whistle, how many nights to blow with aspire to
meet flowers
> MogariBue, Ikuyo mogarase Hana ni Awan
> モガリ笛 いく夜 もがらせ 花ニ逢はん

“That’s it! Mogari Whistle. The whistling sound of a winter night blowing through the bamboo fence. You should not hear the sound with your ears, but react to it with your guts...”

 His footsteps seemed unsteady, but I continued to walk with him.

 “This is the attack whistle that only you can blow, just like you used to.”

Splash Splash

The crests of waves in a belt were absorbed into the seashore with their sound.
