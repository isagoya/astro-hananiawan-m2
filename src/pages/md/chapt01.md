## Mt. Oppadake

I was on my way home from visiting our family grave with my brother Yoshiyasu, who was two years older than me. Okinawan folk songs were playing from the car radio. It was late April 1996 in Okinawa, and the mountains were standing there noisily, wrapped in the sunshine. “It is this wind that invites the moisture of nature. Urizun (February and March in the lunar calendar) is the best time of the year!”

“That's so true. Toshio, do you remember this place? When we went to visit my aunt in Izumi, we walked this path together. We got scared on our way and ran through holding our hands. Look, the water level of the Ōigawa River has decreased a lot. By the way, have you ever climbed Mt. Oppadake?”

“As I remember, when I was in the first grade of elementary school, I followed my older brothers to pick raspberries. I was told to throw stones into the bush before entering there, because there were Hubs, (poisonous snakes in Okinawa) waiting under the branches of the raspberries to catch small birds, and so I put my feet into the bush full of fear, entered with trepidation... that was more than 40 years ago!”

“Yes, right, ... We still have time, so let's take a side trip.”

From the middle of the villages of Tamashiro and Gogayama, our car headed west, reviving the sound of engine. The road was wide enough only for a few cars to pass each other, but the paved road extended so far into the mountains.

“Is this a community road?”

“No, I don't think more than a dozen cars pass here every day. Nowadays, roads are being built all over the place with signs saying 'Act on Special Measures for the Promotion and Development of Okinawa'. They are killing nature by continuing to cut down mountains and pour concrete just to let cars drive on them... They burned down mountains in the war, and now they are pouring government money into the mountains to cut down trees. Just when the mountains are finally regaining their original appearance, the human violence destroying them one after another is completely beyond help...” said my brother, a teacher and environmental activist. His voice was full of anger.

“What is that light pale-yellow-green tree in the middle of the mountain? It looks like covered with cotton wool”

“Oh, that is a Japanese chinquapin.”

“What a sweet smelling for a while!”

“It is the scent of Japanese chinquapin and Indian Hawthorn. It is the time of year when the scent of flowers competes with the scent of fresh green. The cluster of plants around here is at most 50 years old, but the area is a mixture of subtropical and temperate zones. They say, “In the past, this area was covered with dense camphor forests, but most of the original appearance was lost when the Japanese Army cut down the trees for military material and then the area was burned down by U.S. Navy gunfire”.

The car climbed up the road about 20 minutes and stopped.

“Toshio, this is the place called Kusunokiyama. My family fled to this mountain during the war. Let's get out of the car and take a walk.

As we got out of the car, the shiny leafy forest area spread out to catch the sun. The soft and warm breeze shakes the leaves, and the wind blush on the mountain surface is cool, and they go through making a complex wind path in my body.

“Keep going up the road and you can reach the top of Mt. Oppadake. I suppose, the peak is about 270 meters high. Now it has been developed as an observation deck with a radio transmitting station for TV in the middle.”

My brother entered a grove of trees and walked down the gentle slope as if used to it. I followed him with my footstep uncertain because of humus. After a while he stopped under a camphor tree as thick as his waist and stroked its trunk.

“It must be over 80 years old from this thickness. How dare you live so long!”

“Brother, do you have any memories of the war?”

“I was only three years old then...So, I have just a faint memory of being carried on my grandmother's back in the rain.”

Maybe this camphor tree looked down on us running away during the war. We went back to the car and drove up to the top of Mt. Oppadake. When we reached the gently sloping summit and got out of the car, we held our breath in wonder. As if a piece of cloud had been left behind, white clovers covered the hill, their petals dancing in the wind. “It's amazing, isn't it? This is the first time to see such a dense colony of clovers.”

The viewing platform was quiet, except for a young couple huddled together.

“This time of year, the area is covered with a blue haze caused by the yellow sand that comes from China. The village right below us is Nakasone. It is the village where my family lived for about 10 years after we were repatriated from Minamidaitō Island. The chimney over there is the sugar factory, so the forest a little to the left, is where our house used to be.”

The village he pointed to stretched out in front of the foothills.

“The sea over there is the East China Sea, and the island with gently sloping front is Kouri Island. A bridge over there is to be built soon. On the right is the Hanechi Inland Sea. In front of it, looks like contiguous is Yagaji Island, yes, that is Yagaji...”

My brother repeated only the name of Yagaji Island twice.

----Ah, Yagaji, we stayed there for three years. It has been thirty-six years since we escaped from Yagaji Island-----.

When we came back home from Yambaru (a generic name for the northern part of Okinawa Island), my mother and my sisters, Yoneko and Atsuko were waiting anxiously for our return which was later than expected.

“You made a leisurely drive, didn’t you? I hear you climbed Mt. Oppadake, how was it? Kusunokiyama is not the same as it used to be...That mountain left nothing but fear to my childhood, yet it's strange, I always want to visit there whenever something happens...”

Atsuko making the tea told us that she has visited there many times.

“We would never talk about Ikusayū (war years) face to face without an opportunity like today... Obā (mom), you are the key person of today, so you have to answer Toshio's interview properly.”

“Ah, can I recall the past? I’m getting too old...”

The switch of the tape recorder was set to on.

## Minamidaito Island

My name is Iha Toshio, born on March 14, 1943, on Minamidaito Island, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, the fourth of four sons and six daughters, including two half-siblings, when my father was 46 and my mother 39 years old.

Minamidaito Island is located 350 km east of Okinawa Island in the sea, and covers an area of 26 square kilometers. It is a flat plateau surrounded by steep cliffs and is a small island whose main product has been brown sugar ever since. My family was a relatively wealthy farmer with 13 hectares of land and five servants. Today, we can understand that we occupied a large plot of land from my late father's description of “a light railroad running through our field”.

My mother, who is 92 years old, frowns and tries to remember those days.

“Ojī (father) was fashionable, so as soon as he finished his farm work, he used to put on a white suit and Panama hat and go out, but after the army had arrived, his clothes were quickly put away in the closet.”

“In 1944, right after Toshio's birthday, a large number of guards came to our house, perhaps 350 or so. Then the general and the higher officials came together. They showed us a flimsy order sheet that said, 'Tomorrow at noon, we will confiscate this house as the Headquarters Regiment.

“No, how could we resist them? Unfortunately, our house was the largest one on the island...Then the others were also evicted, and the soldiers occupied their houses. The Simantyū (islanders) had no choice but to live in workshops or barns. The soldiers always had first priority”.

On February 17, 1944, the Truk Islands, the central base of the Allied fleet in the Pacific, were captured by the U.S. 58th Task Force, and in July, the island of Saipan was also taken. As a result, Daito Island became an increasingly important keystone in the defense line.

Under the policy of “defending to the death Daito Island, the eastern mainland defense line”, the Imperial General Headquarters of the Japanese Army decided to integrate the 85th Logistics Garrison stationed on Daito Island into the 32nd Army to strengthen the defense of the eastern mainland defense line of Daito Island.

The cargo ship Minami Maru had already been torpedoed and sunk in the waters around Daito Island, and Oki Daito Island was also under submarine attack. The supply force sent to reinforce the defenses of Daito Island was also in a tense situation, as Captain Yokota and 19 men were killed in action just before landing.

Shortly thereafter, a military order was issued to the residents of Daito Island: All civilians should evacuate to Miyazaki Prefecture.

“My husband negotiated with the command headquarters again and again because he could not evacuate to faraway Miyazaki alone, leaving Unnmē (his mother) on the main island of Okinawa.”

His “ex-wife” and their daughter Yoshiko stayed in Nakijin village because Yoshiko was suffering from tuberculosis.

After repeated negotiations, our family was finally allowed to return home on a special military ship.

“Since there was no port on Minamidaito Island, we were first dropped off at a barge by a mokko (a device for carrying heavy loads, usually made of bamboo and woven grass or rope) suspended from a crane, and then transferred to the ship off the coast. It took three days to get to Okinawa, when it usually took less than a day. That was because we had to free ourselves from an American submarine. We went back and forth on the sea. We were forbidden to use lights or raise our voices to avoid being caught by their detectors. Toshio had just turned one, and it was hard not to make him cry. Torpedoes whizzed past us, and explosions rocked the ship again and again. "Awarimunyasa Ikusaya (War is pitiful).”

On October 10, 1944, it was a crisp, clear morning on the island of Okinawa.

The U.S. 38th Task Force first launched some 130 fighter planes and quickly took control of the airspace. Then more than 1,000 bombers pounded military installations, major cities, and villages. That day, the first air raid lasted from 7:00 to 8:20 a.m., the second from 9:20 a.m. for about an hour, the third from 11:45 to 12:30 p.m., and the fourth from 12:40 to 1:40 p.m. The fifth raid lasted from 2:45 to 3:45 p.m., when 500 tons of bombs and incendiary bombs rained down on the islanders.

Flames consume cities and villages, and black smoke covers the sky.

My two sisters began to talk, piecing together their remaining memories.

“The air raid happened shortly after we arrived in Nakijin from Minamidaito Island, and we didn't even have time to unpack our bags. The air raids lasted from about 7:00 in the morning until the evening, and most of our village was burned to the ground, including my house.

“The friendly forces? Japanese army? No, no, totally non-resistance! It was just a one-sided attack by the U.S.”.

My mother interrupted.

“On the day of the air raid, October 10, Yoshiko died coughing up blood. She had been suffering from her illness for a long time... No, she was not killed by a bullet, she died from the shock of coughing up blood. My family didn't even prepare an air-raid shelter because there was only my grandmother and Yoshiko, who was sick, in Nakijin, so we didn't dig it.”

“How old was my grandmother then, Yoneko?”

“Well, she would have been 66 years old...”

Atsuko leaned forward.

“Toshio, if you remember, when you crossed the village hall towards Jana, you saw a small river on your left. Our family fled across it to the Tonuka Cave.”

Yoneko and Atsuko said they were all small children, confirming the ages of the family members at the time.

“My older brother, Okiyoshi, was 22 years old at the time, drafted into the army and assigned to the Northern Branch. Okinori was 14, I was 12, Atsuko was 8, Fumiko was 6, Yoshiyasu was 3, Toshio was 2, and Chieko was not yet born”.

“It's unusual that no one went missing during the war...”

My mother muttered and put her palms together.

Suddenly, I remembered my father. My eyes went to the Buddhist altar.

My father, who never stopped referring to the Self-Defense Forces as the Japanese Army. And he never tried to visit Minamidaito Island again. Sometimes he would mutter, “If only there were no war going on.”

The year 1945 also began with another air raid by the U.S. military.

Air raids were repeated. In particular, on March 23, thousands of U.S. planes flew across the skies of Okinawa. The Grumman fighter jets swooped down so low that residents could see the faces of American soldiers, and they were so thorough that they sought out moving targets and machine-gunned them.

Bombings shook the land, incendiary bombs scorched the air, and the ship's artillery shells blew away trees. Residents thought they could even hear the shouts of American soldiers coming ashore.

“Well, Yoneko, the sea from Bisezaki to Kourijima Island was jammed with American warships as if they were building rafts, wasn't it?”

My sister Yoneko nodded and continued her story with a shrug.

“There was naval gunfire, day and night. We even ran away from the Tonuka Caves, afraid of the Americans might land soon. Then we climbed Mt. Kusunokiyama. My father led the way. I carried Yoshiyasu on my back, followed by Atsuko and Fumiko, then my mother carried Toshio on her back, and my brother Okinori was the last. This formation of our families moving in single file continued until the end of the war.

“Let me tell you about the naval gunfire. Toshio, you have seen the Gulf War on TV, didn't you? It was exactly the same. A multilayered band of light from the warships came toward the island. The mountains were blown away when we heard the explosion... When the shooting started, our father shouted, 'They're coming. Hide!' and we followed his voice.

“Sister, his voice sounded so loud then, didn’t it?” Each of us leaned against the trunk of a large camphor tree to avoid the shooting.

“Atsuko would have been 8 and Fumiko 6. Remembering that time, I am proud of them for not crying...The mountains shook and the camphor leaves fell silently. Shivering, they clung to the tree trunks on the opposite side from where the rain of shells were falling.

“As soon as the artillery fire was over, the surveillance planes came in low over our heads. I still remember the sound of their engines as they buzzed over the mountains. The artillery fire and the surveillance planes took turns. My body was shaking, but somehow my mind was cool.”

“We covered our roofs with tree branches and the inhabitants scattered here and there to hide. Toshio cried a lot! The people who hid with us kicked us a lot, saying that if Toshio cried, the Americans would find us."

My mother interrupted her.

"My breasts did not come out because there was nothing to eat,” she said. “Toshio cried because he was so hungry. Nothing could be done. Our family was thrown out and had to run away from the ship's cannons... It was the time of year when the raspberries were ripe, and Toshio ate them a lot. He finally stopped crying when I put the berries into his mouth. It must have been about ten days since we hid in the mountains. Our uncle from the East was with us, but you were crying so much that he urged me to kill you, saying, “Put this rag in his mouth and kill him!"

Tears fell from my mother's eyes.

“War ruins even the heart of people... I couldn't do such a thing...” He was furious. He hit me with the rag...”

Mother stared at her own hands for a moment, then continued, shaking her head widely.

“He said, 'If I go with you, they will find us and kill me. He ran out of the cave. As soon as the earth rumbled, I heard him crying and screaming. 'Iha's father, give me some water! Please help me!' There was nothing I could do. His screams didn't last long.

When our mother stopped talking, the war came back to my sisters, who were girls at the time.

“Yoneko, the American artillery fire was very accurate. That's why we had to move as soon as the guns stopped. People didn't understand why the flares were shot. When the flares go up, it was bright as daylight. People would start moving because of that light, so it was like telling the U.S. where we were all the way over there...”.

“Atsuko, was it on the way down to Mt. Goga? In the hollows of the mountain path, soldiers and townspeople had their torsos blown off, their arms and legs shredded, and were screaming, 'Help me! Ouch, it hurts! Blue flames were still burning from their bodies, but there was nothing we could do...”

“Our father's voice was loud at his best. 'Single file! Don't look around! Look ahead, just ahead!'“

“Japanese army soldiers? No, they did not protect the local people. In fact, they even took away our food. They took off their uniforms and ran around among the civilians. It got especially bad after the Americans landed in April... Some families were suspected of being spies and were cut down and killed by the Japanese forces. They were all innocent. And their corpses were displayed for a long time as an example to the residents...”

The residents were forced to evacuate Oppayama due to the repeated and intense bombing. They were gradually driven into dugouts near villages and the Kikkoubaka (Turtleback shaped tomb).

On April 20, the northern area of Okinawa Prefecture was completely put under the control of US forces. At the same time, cries of “Come out, come out!” rang out all over the mountain areas as the US forces intensified their scattering operations in search of the enemy.

“As we huddled together in the Kikkoubaka, we saw American boots in the bright light. Then a black muzzle was pointed at us inside the tomb. Then, driven by the voice of 'Come out, come out,' we were all dragged out of the shelters and graves. People went out with their hands in front of their faces.... They were held at the point of a gun, and all were lined up in rows to check whether they were civilians or soldiers.”

Yoneko's soft voice grew louder.

“Then something terrible happened. Mama, it was father's belt, wasn't it? He happened to be wearing a soldier's belt, and they pulled him forward. They suspected that he was a soldier. Three American soldiers surrounded him, and one of them tried to pull the trigger. Then two soldiers rushed in to stop him.”

“No! Not army! Babies, all small!”

“He almost got shot. Then the soldiers ordered him by gesture to take off his belt .... Then they threw away father's belt.”

“Do you ask me whether all American soldiers are good people or not? No, not necessarily. Once a pimply-faced soldier came and pulled our mother out at gunpoint. She was still young, and he threatened her to follow him. He tried to lower Toshio down from his mother’s back. Gah! The American suddenly screamed and ran back in a hurry...

“Toshio bit the AMERIKAA's (Okinawan dialect: American) nose. Toshio saved my life.”

My mother giggled and then laughed out loud.

## Tōnuka Cave

“Toshio, why does your sand mound got so many stripes? Make a proper triangle!”

Yasuo, began to yell at me like a bully.

I tried to make sand mound again and again, but every time my crooked little finger of left hand struck it, and I could not make a sandhill without streaks.

“I remember when Toshio was in the third grade. I watched him running from behind, and I thought he had a strange way of running with his left toe down.

Judging from my own memory and that of my family, I estimate that I contracted Hansen's disease at the age of eight or nine. Based on the incubation period, I would say that I was infected when I was one or two years old.

I really wanted to know the rout of my infection.

“Grandma, did any of our close relatives have the same disease as me?”

“No, no one.”

“What about the neighbors?”

“No.”

Suddenly, my mother began to talk strange things.

“It was in Tōnuka Cave that Toshio was infected ...We had no choice but to flee to Tōnuka Cave because we had just returned from Minamidaito Island and couldn't dig our own air raid shelter. The whole village warned us, saying, “Iha's father, you will be in big trouble if you take such little children to that cave. It used to be the dwelling of lepers. ...But we had no choice because there were no bomb shelters for us to escape to...Until ten days before we entered the cave, the lepers lived there. Then the soldiers came and took them to Yagaji. In the cave of Tōnuka there still remained some rags they had used. I made you crawl around naked in the cave, that's how you got sick."

My mother uses the terms “Buddhist saint” or “blood patient” to refer to the leprosy patients. Her story was connected with the following events.

------In 1944, Commander Ushijima of the Japanese Army mobilized the troops under his command to hunt down lepers throughout Okinawa. It is said that the beginning was leprosy patients who happened to be hiding in the seized quarters of Commander Ushijima's General Staff Headquarters. The military-led hunt of lepers began in May 1944 and ended on September 21. This operation was conducted throughout the island of Okinawa and was thoroughgoing that it resembled a military operation. At that time, Okinawa Airakuen, a public leprosy sanatorium, had a fixed number of beds for 430 patients, but the number of patients admitted to the sanatorium more than doubled to 913 as a result of the hunt.

When my mother told me that I had been infected in the Tonuka cave, I objected it as impossible and mentioned the conditions of Hansen’s disease infection one by one. First, there should be a patient nearby who has shed germs and my skin has repeated contact with that person. You cannot get infected by airborne infection.

My mother asked several questions about my explanation.

“So, you think it wasn't then?”

“There must have been a patient nearby who infected me the disease, so try to remember the situation.

“Nuu, Toshio, ninbuchi watarumuncha ta-kuuran! (No, no one has passed leprosy to you!)”

At that time my mother said “pass” instead of the dialect “infect”.

------ Ah, this is her reproach using dialects, for my stupidity in searching for the relationship and origin of the disease I thought. Then my mother looked at me and said clearly, “Uriya ikusadoyaru! (It’s because of the war!)”
