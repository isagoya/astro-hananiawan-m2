## Doorplate

The year-end drinking parties continued day after day.

Whenever you have a hangover, nothing is better than listening to Cazarus. December 16th, 1990. I was reading the newspaper and sipping a coffee stronger than usual. Suddenly the phone rang. The early Sunday morning bell rang higher than usual. Especially on such a morning when I felt sluggish...

“Hello...hello...it’s me...”

“Hello, this is Iha. Who is this?”

“This is Akiko. It’s been a while.”

“Oh, it’s you...”

Unexpectedly, it was the call of my ex-wife Akiko.

It was after ten years to hear her voice on the phone.

“How are you?”

“I’m fine. How are the kids?”

“They’re all fine...After that, new...”

“What?”

“Did you get married again?”

“Oh no, I’m still alone.”

“You’ve been all alone, I see...”

“What’s the matter? Did something happen?

“Sorry for the sudden call. Actually, Ryo just wants to see you. What should I do?”

“What does your husband say?”

“He says, ‘Ryo is 18 years old, so we cannot neglect his own will.’ And I have his permission. What should I do? I myself am ready for it.”

“What do you mean, ready?”

“Ryo has not spoken to my husband since he entered high school, and he insists on leaving the house after high school.”

“Is your husband with you?”

“Yes. He is sitting right in front of me. “

“And Ryo?”

“He is in his room. Could you please speak to him?”

“Okay, I will.”

“Just a few minutes, please. I’ll bring him here.”

I could hear the sound of him coming down the stairs through the phone receiver.

“Hello, this is Ryo. Father, Dad?”

“Yes, I am.”

“Well, can I go to Tokyo? Can I visit you? The winter vacation is coming soon. I’d like to go to Tokyo to see you on Sunday the 23rd.”

“Next Sunday, right? I don’t mind. Have you talked enough with your family?”

“Yes, I have. There’s no problem.”

“I understand...”

“So, you are well. I think I will arrive in Tokyo on the evening of December 23rd.”

“I see. What time should I go to Tokyo Station to meet you?”

“Oh, no. You don’t have to worry about that. I remember our house in Higashimurayama. I can come by myself. It’s the 23rd. Are you sure? I’ll switch the phone with my mother.”

“I’m sorry to bother you, and I appreciate your kindness.”

On the 23rd of December, I had been restless since the early morning. I was thinking about how to meet my son again after ten years. Well, let it be...anyway, be as calm as I can. I made up my mind and prepared myself.

-----Ding Dong-----

“Hello! I’m here. Ryo is here.”

“Oh, the door is open.”

I went to the front door where my son was, looking embarrassed. I looked at him, looking for any sign of him from when we parted eight years ago. It was shameful, but I could not be sure to fill in his appearance, his figure, and the void of ten years.

-----In that case, I might not be able to call out “Hi!” to him if we happened to pass each other on the way-----

“Nice to see you. Come on in.”

“How are you?”

“Yah.”

“Sorry, but may I look around the rooms first?”

Ryo went to the children’s room on the south side first, then slowly made his way around the house.

His eyes were moist when I looked up at him.

“You’ve grown up!”

“I’m 172cm tall, almost average. The furniture is the same as before, and you didn’t remove the seals Yui and I put on, you kept them...”

“Well, removing them was annoying. Besides, they were the only thing I could smell from you two.”

“Thank you. When I arrived here, the first thing I did was to look at the nameplate. My name and Yui’s name were next to yours. To tell the truth, I came here afraid and worried, if the name of an unknown lady was on the doorplate, what should I do?”

“No, I’ve learned my lesson. Good for you for coming here alone. Didn’t you get lost?”

“No problem. I got off at Higashimurayama Station and remembered the Ito-Yokado store.”

“I see. Sit down anyway. Japanese tea okay?”

My son watched my hands carefully as I prepared the tea.

His ‘Tokyo Kitatama Ward Map’ looked like it had been repaired several times and was worn out.

“I bought this map with my New Year’s gift money. They built a nice sports center in front of the junior high school, so I almost turned left and went the wrong way.”

“Is Yui doing well?”

“Yes, she is preparing for the high school entrance exam next spring and says she is in her last sprint from now on. It’s better than doing nothing. You know, we tell her it’s a little late.”

“Well, where do you live now?”

“In Hiroshima. A younger sister was born.”

“Oh, you have a younger sister. That would have been good for your mother, wouldn’t it?”

“...”

Then Ryo corrected his posture and put his hands together on the table.

“Father, it’s been ten years since we promised.”

“Oh yes, it’s been ten years...”

-----He had kept it in his mind.

“I want to stay with Dad. I don’t want to go with mom!” Ryo had said.

He kept crying until two days before we left, and I was in trouble. Therefore I took him to the bench in the frog park behind our house and talked to him alone.

“Mother and Yui are girls, right? They need a boy to help them, right? So, Ryo, you have to take the role of...” I convinced him.

“...Okay...Is it wrong for Ryo and Yui to stay with Dad? Is that because your hands hurt? Ryo and Yui are too small to cook or wash or help you and so it will be trouble for Dad?”

“Yes, it will.”

As soon as he heard my answer, Ryo’s expression changed. It was enough to scare his father.

“Hm, I understand. Ryo and Yui would be patient to go with mom. Can I come to dad if I can take care of myself and help you?”

“Sure.”

He spread his hands in front of me.

I counted his fingers one by one, all ten.

“Okay, Dad. If I’m after the tenth grade, right?”

“That’s right!”

“But who will do your buttons from now on?”

“Don’t worry, I’ll do my best.”

Every morning before I went to work, buttoning bothered me.

Ryo had watched it for some time and put his hands on my shirts and said, “I’ll do it for you.” After that, buttoning became Ryo’s daily chore. He was worried about it.

-----He was eight years old then---so already eighteen years old-----

“Father, could you please change my family name back to Iha?”

“What will your parents say?”

“I don’t care. This is my problem.”

“It’s not. Ryo, listen, whatever the reason was, I could not raise my children. It’s the same as if I threw them away...”

“Whatever you say, I am Iha Ryo."

“Your father in Hiroshima brought you up to this point. I can’t thank you enough. Think about it with a human mind. It cannot be allowed. Besides, the family name is nothing but a social distinction."

“I want to stick to this. Who am I?”

“No. You two, Ryo and Yui, should blame and reject me with all your life for throwing you away.”

“Please tell me. What happened between you and my mom? Did you try your best between the two of you?”

“...”

“I’ve been telling Yui since she was six years old, ‘Look, this is a secret, but the real father of Ryo and Yui is in Tokyo.’“

“I’m sorry, the whole reason is that I tried to do what was beyond my power. I underestimated society. As a result, I crushed you both. I have no word to answer whether I tried my best. It may sound like my self-justification, but there was no other way to get you out of a certain situation. Above all, it was necessary for your mother to feel comfortable as a woman."

“In your opinion, children have no choice in their family names.”

“...”

“It was in my mind never to say this in public... But I was lonely for a long time...”

“...”

The discussion about changing the family name continued until the next morning.

“I don’t agree with you, but I’ll put it on hold for now.”

That was his last word on the subject, and he never mentioned it again. I still do

not know what he really thought or how he came to that conclusion in his mind.

The next day, I saw my son off at Tokyo Station. Ryo stood at the door of Super Express Hikari and called to me,

“Father, I’ll be back. And... you can go now. I hope you find the nice lady soon.”

“None of your business!”

After that, Ryo got permission from his parents in Hiroshima and began to study for four years with my financial support. After all, there was no other way for me to be accused by the miserable feeling of acting as his father only with economic support.

Half a year later, I met my daughter Yui at Hiroshima Station. Afraid that she might not understand me, my ex-wife Akiko accompanied her. As I stepped out of the gate, Akiko waved at me with her stiff face.

“Hi!”

“How are you?”

“Fine.”

My daughter, who had just entered the high school, stared at our greetings. I gave her a little nod and the next moment she was clinging to my neck.

Yui, who always sang “Candy Candy” with a flirtatious gesture, hugged me.

I was amazed at the swelling of her chest that I could feel through her coat and was beaten by the days that had passed.

## Underground Stem

I remarried to Shigeko in December 1993.

My meeting with Shigeko began during the period when I was preparing to return to society from the Hansen’s disease sanatorium, going back and forth with nurses from the Akitsu treatment facility for children with severe motor and mental disabilities.

In Higashimurayama Second Junior High School, the branch of Tama Zenshoen, the number of students had dwindled to less than ten, and the teachers were disappointed that it was impossible to form a team to play softball as a class assignment. Knowing this, I decided to recruit some students from Akitsu Treatment Facility. Shigeko’s figure, which was the smallest and moved quickly, remained in my mind.

We had no personal contact after 25 years. We only greeted each other when she occasionally visited the cultural school sponsored by the institution I was running.

It was February 1993. I went to the supermarket after work and came home with some ingredients for dinner and found a small package hanging on the doorknob. I opened it and found two storied plates of side dishes with a letter.

-----I cooked them with vegetables from my country. I don’t know if it’s good enough for you. No need to return the plates. From Kuma-chan.

The next day, I looked up the phone number of the kindergarten where she works and thanked her. Three days later, an envelope arrived in my mailbox.

-----I received an unofficial notice from the director. I have no confidence and I am undecided what to do-----

It had her address and phone number.

It was the first time I knew her name was “Shigeko Yanagisawa” because everyone always called her Kuma-chan.

“Hello, this is Iha. You should accept the principal’s message. It will be good for you to take care of the children at their level.”

After that, the relationship with Shigeko, who had appeared out of the blue, had begun. It was really strange, but with each conversation with Shigeko, my awakened heart began to receive warmth, something like happiness. My heart, which had not been opened for decades, came to life again.

“How did Kōta’s Ultraman transformation go today?”

“On the balance beam, he put his arms on his hips, his face tense and red, but disappointed, and said, ‘Oh, no. Not today either. I’m going to eat a lot. I can’t carry you on my back yet, Aunt Teacher. I’ll try again tomorrow. Wait for me.

It had been half a year since Kōta became a topic of conversation at our dinner table.

It was very amusing to listen to the daily reports of 100 children. Sometimes I thought I knew the faces of all the children I’d never seen.

“It was funny during the nap today. You remember Yū, the handicapped boy, don’t you? Haruka, a precocious girl, usually takes care of Yū. Today she was crying during lunch, holding the cup in her hand. She does everything quickly, but eats slowly and is always rushed by the nurses.”

Shigeko imitated Haruka’s eating gesture.

“Did something happen to her?”

“I went to the Lemon class, she was crying with eyes full of tears and said, ‘Auntie, Yū is mean to me. It’s not the sports meeting, but Yū is yelling at me, ‘Go for it! Go for it!”

I burst out laughing.

Sometimes there was a talk that made us think about the concept of time.

“Auntie, were you born during the war?” Kōhei asked the question abruptly.

“No, I was not born yet.”

“Oh, I see. That’s why you’re alive today.”

I could clearly see the richness of the conversation between parent and child as Shōhei spoke proudly of his newly acquired knowledge.

“The earth moves, they say.”

Shunpei speaks proudly and with amazement about his new knowledge.

“That’s right.”

“The earth moves because people work hard, they say. The earth rotates so that day and night alternate.”

“Really?”

“Yes, it does. Besides, if children don’t play well, the earth slows down and it goes on all night, and we can’t play outside, so I’ll do my best!”

Episodes from the nursery never ended.

Ryo, who had gotten his job in Nagoya, and Yui in Hiroshima began visiting our new home in Tokyo together.

“Yui, do you remember teacher Atsuko? She said you were the most spoiled child. She was my best friend. She used to tell me about Ryo and Yui. She always said, ‘I have to take good care of them’...”

“Oh, teacher Akko! I remember Akko. Is she doing well?”

“She married and lives in Akita.”

When the children come to visit us, they happily spend more time with Shigeko than with me.

After a while, Ryo teased me by saying, “Dad, you’re pretty good. You have a good eye for women. Very good.
