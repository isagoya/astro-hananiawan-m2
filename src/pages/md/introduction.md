## Introduction

In 1958, at the age of 15, I celebrated my second June at "Okinawa Airakuen," a sanatorium for Hansen's disease in Okinawa Prefecture.  
The Nobel Prize winner in literature, Kawabata Yasunari, spoke to me with his hands on my knees. "Write a lot, my dear, and store them inside you." I can hear his call from the depths of my memory, the quiet voice that introduced me to the joy of reading.  
Books were filled with dreams that could flap their wings. There was no world in which people humiliated others, let alone denied human life by a single 'stigma'.  
Written words bring joy to the people. This conviction grew stronger as I got older.  
I wanted to write about "Hansen’s disease" that had overtaken me. More than ten years have passed since I became obsessed with this idea and, strangely enough, it was the abolition of the "Leprosy Prevention Law" in April 1996 that gave me the motivation to challenge my dream.  
Writing about the 'illness' is not much fun for me. It takes a lot of determination to dig up my pains and recall the memories of days gone by. Not to mention that the deeper the grief and the heavier the pain, the harder it was.  
The act of recalling the memories of family members and others involved and connecting them through writing was also a journey of self-reflection. Like stop-motion, scenes from that time came to my mind; the sounds of that time, the colors I encountered, even the smells.  
The act of "writing down myself" begins from self-dismantling. Then, I have to bring forth myself, who looks at me with cool eyes.  
What I've tried to keep in mind before writing about my past is to try to compose from a bird's eye view as much as possible.

At the "House of Prayer" in Airakuen, the sermon "The Last Supper" by Mr. Tokuda, one of the Sunday school teachers, spoke to the uneasy heart of 14-year-old boy.  
"Leonardo da Vinci begins his painting by first drawing Christ in the center of the canvas. It was easy to find His model. It was the same with the other models as disciples. But he could hardly find the model for Judas, who was the last one left. Da Vinci traveled across the country for days in search of the model for Judas. He went into a small town and found a crowd of people shouting and cursing.  
‘Hit the thieve! Hit the criminal, Hit him harder and harder!’  
What is going on? Da Vinci lifted his head and looked into the crowd to see a beggar being hit by the shopkeeper. The beggar was crying and begging for forgiveness, but it didn't look like he was going to get it easily.  
Feeling pity on the beggar, Da Vinci hands the shopkeeper a few gold coins and finally saved the crying beggar.  
The beggar thanked him for saving him and kissed his feet. Then the beggar lifted his tear-stained face and ‘smirked’.  
Oh, this is the guy!  
This beggar is exactly the Judas I have been looking for!  
Da Vinci rushed home with the beggar and was finally able to put Judas on canvas.  
At last, ‘The Last Supper’ was finished.  
Da Vinci gave the beggar gold coins as a reward. The beggar, clutching them tightly saying, ‘Sir, this is the second time you have given me coins; the first time was when I served as the model of this man.’  
The beggar pointed at the center of the finished picture ‘The Last Supper.’"  
The eyes of the 14-year-old boy sitting on the far right in the second row of the church caught Christ and Judas.

The 89 years of "bad law" enforced against Hansen's disease patients is a history of forcing the sick to abandon their human beings. That is why the "stigmatized" continue to shed endless tears that never dry up.  
The "Leprosy Prevention Law," which caused so much suffering and sorrow to humanity, yet so easily drew its curtain contrary to the weight of its sordid history. Society has left Hansen’s disease patients behind, even forgetting their existence, and trying to erase and bury them as peacefully as possible from the history of Japanese medical administration.  
What has the past 89 years of Hansen’s disease been all about? Japanese people living in the country of Japan today need to answer this question.

This book is a memoir of my life and a message to readers from a person who suffered from Hansen's disease. I hope that as many people as possible will read this and reflect on it with their own hearts and souls.  
In some parts of the book, the term "leprosy" is used to refer to the disease as it relates to historical background and proper nouns, but the expression is unified as " Hansen's disease" today.
